  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers. The program should use the formula std_dev = sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2) / (n - 1)) to calculate the standard deviation.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers using the given formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_mean(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The mean of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The standard deviation of the list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\ndef main():\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)\n    std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\n    \n    print(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\n    print(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program consists of three functions:\n\n1.  `calculate_mean(numbers)`: This function calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing up all the numbers and dividing by the total count of numbers.\n2.  `calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)`: This function calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers using the formula `std_dev = sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2) / (n - 1))`. It first calculates the mean of the numbers using the `calculate_mean` function, then calculates the variance by summing up the squared differences between each number and the mean, and finally returns the square root of the variance.\n3.  `main()`: This function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_mean` and `calculate_standard_deviation` functions by providing a sample list of numbers, calculating the mean and standard deviation, and printing the results.\n\nTo use this program, simply replace the `numbers` list in the `main` function with your own list of numbers and run the program. The program will print out the mean and standard deviation of the list.",
