  "answer": "Here is a Python program that uses a for loop to simulate rolling a dice n times, and then prints the frequency of each outcome:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_dice(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates rolling a dice n times and prints the frequency of each outcome.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of times to roll the dice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each outcome\n    frequency = {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0}\n\n    # Simulate rolling the dice n times\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Roll the dice (generate a random number between 1 and 6)\n        roll = random.randint(1, 6)\n        # Increment the frequency of the current outcome\n        frequency[roll] += 1\n\n    # Print the frequency of each outcome\n    print(\"Outcome\\tFrequency\")\n    for outcome, count in frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{outcome}\\t{count}\")\n\n# Example usage\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of times to roll the dice: \"))\nroll_dice(n)\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `roll_dice` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of times to roll the dice.\n2. The function initializes a dictionary `frequency` to store the frequency of each outcome (1 to 6).\n3. The function simulates rolling the dice `n` times using a for loop.\n4. In each iteration of the loop, the function generates a random number between 1 and 6 using `random.randint(1, 6)`, which represents the outcome of the current roll.\n5. The function increments the frequency of the current outcome by 1 in the `frequency` dictionary.\n6. After simulating all `n` rolls, the function prints the frequency of each outcome.\n7. The example usage at the end of the program prompts the user to enter the number of times to roll the dice, and then calls the `roll_dice` function with the user's input.\n\nNote: You can also use `random.choices` to generate a list of random outcomes and then use the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each outcome. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport random\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef roll_dice(n):\n    rolls = random.choices(range(1, 7), k=n)\n    frequency = Counter(rolls)\n    print(\"Outcome\\tFrequency\")\n    for outcome, count in frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{outcome}\\t{count}\")\n\n# Example usage\nn = int(input(\"Enter the number of times to roll the dice: \"))\nroll_dice(n)\n```\nThis implementation is more concise and efficient than the original one, but it uses more advanced Python features.",
