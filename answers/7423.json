  "prompt": "Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input. The program should take two numbers and an operation as input and output the result.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that performs the basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\ndef add(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef subtract(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return num1 * num2\n\ndef divide(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if num2 == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return num1 / num2\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1.

The program will output the result of the operation (e.g., 10 + 5 = 15.0).\n- Try entering a non-numeric input (e.g., \"abc\") to see the error handling in action.\n- Choose division and enter 0 as the second number to see the division by zero error handling.",
