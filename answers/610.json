  "answer": "**Rounding a Number to the Nearest Integer**\n====================================================\n\nHere is a simple Python program that rounds a given number to the nearest integer:\n\n```python\ndef round_to_nearest_integer(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a given number to the nearest integer.\n\n    Args:\n        num (float): The number to be rounded.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The rounded integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    return round(num)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5.7\n    rounded_num = round_to_nearest_integer(num)\n    print(f\"The nearest integer to {num} is {rounded_num}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n*   The `round_to_nearest_integer` function takes a float `num` as input.\n*   It uses the built-in `round` function in Python, which rounds a number to the nearest integer.\n*   The rounded integer is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we define a number `num` and pass it to the `round_to_nearest_integer` function.\n*   The rounded integer is printed to the console.\n\n**Note**: The `round` function uses the \"banker's rounding\" algorithm, which means that if the decimal part of the number is exactly halfway between two integers, it will round to the nearest even integer. For example, `round(3.5)` will return `4`, but `round(2.5)` will return `2`. If you need a different rounding behavior, you may need to use a custom implementation.",
