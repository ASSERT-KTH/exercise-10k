  "answer": "### Basic Arithmetic Operations\n#### Code\n```python\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations():\n    # Define two integer variables\n    num1 = 10\n    num2 = 3\n\n    # Perform basic arithmetic operations\n    addition_result = num1 + num2\n    subtraction_result = num1 - num2\n    multiplication_result = num1 * num2\n    division_result = num1 / num2\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    perform_arithmetic_operations()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   This code defines a function `perform_arithmetic_operations()` that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two integer variables `num1` and `num2`.\n*   The results of these operations are stored in separate variables (`addition_result`, `subtraction_result`, `multiplication_result`, `division_result`).\n*   Finally, the code prints out the results of these operations.\n\n#### Output\nWhen you run this code, it will output the results of the arithmetic operations:\n\n```\nAddition: 10 + 3 = 13\nSubtraction: 10 - 3 = 7\nMultiplication: 10 * 3 = 30\nDivision: 10 / 3 = 3.3333333333333335\n```",
