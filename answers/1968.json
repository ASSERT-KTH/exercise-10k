  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that calculates the solutions to a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. This will involve breaking down the problem into manageable parts and providing a clear explanation of the code. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_quadratic_solutions(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the solutions to a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    a (float): The coefficient of the squared term in the quadratic equation.\n    b (float): The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation.\n    c (float): The constant term in the quadratic equation.\n    \n    Returns:\n    tuple: A tuple containing the two solutions to the quadratic equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to calculate the determinant (b^2 - 4ac) to determine the nature of the solutions\n    determinant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    \n    # If the determinant is negative, the solutions will be complex numbers\n    if determinant < 0:\n        # Calculate the real part of the solutions\n        real_part = -b / (2*a)\n        \n        # Calculate the imaginary part of the solutions\n        imaginary_part = math.sqrt(-determinant) / (2*a)\n        \n        # Return the complex solutions\n        return complex(real_part, imaginary_part), complex(real_part, -imaginary_part)\n    \n    # If the determinant is zero, there will be one repeated real solution\n    elif determinant == 0:\n        # Calculate the repeated real solution\n        solution = -b / (2*a)\n        \n        # Return the repeated real solution\n        return solution, solution\n    \n    # If the determinant is positive, there will be two distinct real solutions\n    else:\n        # Calculate the first real solution\n        solution1 = (-b + math.sqrt(determinant)) / (2*a)\n        \n        # Calculate the second real solution\n        solution2 = (-b - math.sqrt(determinant)) / (2*a)\n        \n        # Return the two distinct real solutions\n        return solution1, solution2\n\n# Test the function\nprint(calculate_quadratic_solutions(1, -3, 2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_quadratic_solutions` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the coefficients of the quadratic equation. It calculates the determinant (`b^2 - 4ac`) to determine the nature of the solutions.\n* If the determinant is negative, the function calculates the real and imaginary parts of the complex solutions using the quadratic formula. It returns these complex solutions as a tuple.\n* If the determinant is zero or positive, the function calculates the real solutions using the quadratic formula. For a determinant of zero, it returns two identical real solutions, while for a positive determinant, it returns two distinct real solutions.\n* The code uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the determinant and the `complex` function to create complex numbers when the determinant is negative.",
