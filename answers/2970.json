  "prompt": "Create a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. The program should use a set of coins with different denominations.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses dynamic programming to solve the coin change problem. The program takes the amount and the coin denominations as input and returns the minimum number of coins needed to make the change.\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(amount, coins):\n    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins for each amount from 0 to the given amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    \n    # Base case: 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount\n    dp[0] = 0\n    \n    # For each coin\n    for coin in coins:\n        # For each amount from the coin value to the given amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # If using the current coin results in a smaller number of coins, update the dp list\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n    \n    # If no combination of coins can make the given amount, return -1\n    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return dp[amount]\n\n# Example usage:\namount = 11\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\nprint(min_coins(amount, coins))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `min_coins` function takes two parameters: `amount` and `coins`. The `amount` is the target amount for which we want to find the minimum number of coins, and `coins` is a list of available coin denominations.\n*   We create a list `dp` of size `amount + 1` and initialize it with `float('inf')`, representing infinity. This list will store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the given amount.\n*   We set `dp[0] = 0`, which means 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount.\n*   We iterate through each coin and for each amount from the coin value to the given amount. For each amount `i`, we check if using the current coin results in a smaller number of coins. If it does, we update `dp[i]` with the minimum value.\n*   Finally, we return `dp[amount]`, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the given amount. If no combination of coins can make the given amount, `dp[amount]` will still be `float('inf')`, so we return -1 in that case.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this program is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the target amount and len(coins) is the number of coin denominations.\n*   The space complexity is O(amount), as we need to store the minimum number of coins for each amount from 0 to the given amount.",
