  "answer": "**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can solve this problem using a sliding window approach with the help of a set data structure.\n\n#### Algorithm\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string.\n2. Initialize a set to store unique characters in the current substring.\n3. Initialize variables to store the maximum length and the corresponding substring.\n4. Move the `right` pointer to the right and add the character at the `right` index to the set.\n5. If the character is already in the set, move the `left` pointer to the right until the character is removed from the set.\n6. Update the maximum length and the corresponding substring if the current substring is longer.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    char_set = set()\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n        if right - left + 1 > max_length:\n            max_length = right - left + 1\n            max_substring = s[left:right + 1]\n\n    return max_substring\n\n# Example usage\nprint(longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(\"abcabcbb\"))  # Output: \"abc\"\nprint(longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(\"bbbbb\"))  # Output: \"b\"\nprint(longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(\"pwwkew\"))  # Output: \"wke\"\nprint(longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(\"\"))  # Output: \"\"\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are scanning the string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set. This is because we are using a set to store unique characters in the current substring. In the worst case, the size of the set can be equal to the length of the input string. However, in practice, the size of the set is usually much smaller than the length of the input string.",
