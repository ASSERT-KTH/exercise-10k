  "answer": "Here's an example of a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs in Python:\n\n```python\npeople = {\n    \"John\": 25,\n    \"Alice\": 30,\n    \"Bob\": 35,\n    \"Emma\": 20,\n    \"Michael\": 40\n}\n```\n\nIn this dictionary, the keys are the names of people and the values are their ages. You can access the age of a person by using their name as the key. For example, to get John's age, you would use `people[\"John\"]`.",
