  "prompt": "Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    return fib_sequence\n\nprint(fibonacci(10))\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function `fibonacci(n)` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` numbers. The sequence starts with `[0, 1]`, and then we append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence until the sequence has `n` numbers. Finally, we print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence by calling `fibonacci(10)`.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
