The function checks if the operation is valid and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. It also checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.\n\nThe `main` function gets the numbers and operation from the user, calls the `arithmetic_operation` function, and prints the result. It also catches any exceptions that may be raised and prints the error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Add two numbers: `arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '+')` returns `15.0`\n* Subtract two numbers: `arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '-')` returns `5.0`\n* Multiply two numbers: `arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '*')` returns `50.0`\n* Divide two numbers: `arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '/')` returns `2.0`\n* Invalid operation: `arithmetic_operation(10, 5, '%')` raises a `ValueError`\n* Division by zero: `arithmetic_operation(10, 0, '/')` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`",
