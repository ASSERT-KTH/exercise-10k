  "answer": "**Binary Search Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the target element in a sorted list using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of numbers.\n        target (int): The target element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n\n    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target {target} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the sorted list, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.\n3.  Compare the middle element `sorted_list[mid]` with the target element `target`.\n    *   If they match, return the midpoint index.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search the left half.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until the target is found or the search space is empty (`low > high`).\n5.  If the target is not found, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the length of the sorted list. This is because with each iteration, the search space is reduced by half.",
