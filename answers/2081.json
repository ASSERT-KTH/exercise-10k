  "answer": "Here is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            print(num1, \"+\", num2, \"=\", add(num1, num2))\n\n        elif choice == '2':\n            print(num1, \"-\", num2, \"=\", subtract(num1, num2))\n\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(num1, \"*\", num2, \"=\", multiply(num1, num2))\n\n        elif choice == '4':\n            try:\n                print(num1, \"/\", num2, \"=\", divide(num1, num2))\n            except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n                print(e)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   This program defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, each of which takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.\n*   The `main` function presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose which operation to perform.\n*   Based on the user's choice, the program prompts for two numbers, performs the chosen operation, and prints the result.\n*   For division, the program checks if the second number is zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if so, to prevent division by zero.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Addition: Enter `1` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `10` and `20`. The program will output `10 + 20 = 30.0`.\n*   Subtraction: Enter `2` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `20` and `10`. The program will output `20 - 10 = 10.0`.\n*   Multiplication: Enter `3` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `5` and `6`. The program will output `5 * 6 = 30.0`.\n*   Division: Enter `4` as your choice, then enter two numbers, such as `10` and `2`. The program will output `10 / 2 = 5.0`. If you try to divide by zero, the program will output `Cannot divide by zero.`.",
