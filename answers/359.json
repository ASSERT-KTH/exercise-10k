  "answer": "**Symmetric Difference Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets is a set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. This program calculates the symmetric difference of two input arrays.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the symmetric difference of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The symmetric difference of arr1 and arr2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input lists to sets\n    set1 = set(arr1)\n    set2 = set(arr2)\n\n    # Calculate symmetric difference using set operations\n    symmetric_diff = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n\n    # Convert result back to list and return\n    return list(symmetric_diff)\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n    result = symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Symmetric difference:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `symmetric_difference` function takes two input lists `arr1` and `arr2`.\n2. It converts these lists to sets using the `set()` function.\n3. The symmetric difference is calculated using the `symmetric_difference()` method of the `set` class.\n4. The result is converted back to a list using the `list()` function and returned.\n5. In the example usage, we define two input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, calculate their symmetric difference, and print the result.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nSymmetric difference: [1, 2, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis output shows that the elements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are in either `arr1` or `arr2`, but not in their intersection.",
