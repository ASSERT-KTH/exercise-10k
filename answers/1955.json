  "prompt": "Write a program that takes an array as input and returns the median value of the array.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the built-in `statistics` module to calculate the median:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_median(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of an array.\n    \n    Args:\n    array (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The median of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return statistics.median(array)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(calculate_median(numbers))\n```\n\nIf you want to implement it manually, here's a solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of an array.\n    \n    Args:\n    array (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The median of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the array\n    array.sort()\n    \n    # Get the length of the array\n    length = len(array)\n    \n    # If the length is even\n    if length % 2 == 0:\n        # Calculate the median as the average of the two middle numbers\n        median = (array[length // 2 - 1] + array[length // 2]) / 2\n    else:\n        # Calculate the median as the middle number\n        median = array[length // 2]\n    \n    return median\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(calculate_median(numbers))\n```\n\nThis program works by first sorting the array. Then, it checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. If it's odd, it calculates the median as the middle number.",
