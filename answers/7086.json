  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of an Array of Numbers**\n\nHere's an example code in Python that reads an array of numbers from the user and calculates the average:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the average of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the array of numbers from the user\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: \")\n    try:\n        numbers = [float(num) for num in user_input.split()]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average.\n2. The `main` function reads the array of numbers from the user using the `input` function.\n3. It splits the input string into individual numbers using the `split` method and converts each number to a float using a list comprehension.\n4. If the user enters invalid input (e.g., non-numeric characters), it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message.\n5. It calls the `calculate_average` function to calculate the average of the numbers.\n6. Finally, it prints the result to the console, rounded to two decimal places using the `{average:.2f}` format specifier.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\nEnter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5\nThe average of the numbers is: 3.00\n```",
