  "answer": "**Weighted Score Calculator**\n==========================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the total weighted score given a list of scores and their respective weights.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_weighted_score(scores, weights):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total weighted score.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of scores.\n        weights (list): A list of weights corresponding to the scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total weighted score.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(scores) != len(weights):\n        raise ValueError(\"The number of scores and weights must be equal\")\n\n    total_weighted_score = sum(score * weight for score, weight in zip(scores, weights))\n    total_weight = sum(weights)\n\n    if total_weight == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"The total weight cannot be zero\")\n\n    return total_weighted_score / total_weight\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    scores = [90, 80, 70, 60]\n    weights = [0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3]\n\n    try:\n        total_weighted_score = calculate_weighted_score(scores, weights)\n        print(f\"Total Weighted Score: {total_weighted_score:.2f}\")\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_weighted_score` function takes two lists as input: `scores` and `weights`.\n2. It checks if the lengths of the two lists are equal. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. It calculates the total weighted score by multiplying each score with its corresponding weight and summing them up.\n4. It calculates the total weight by summing up all the weights.\n5. If the total weight is zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n6. It returns the total weighted score divided by the total weight.\n7. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_weighted_score` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Scores: `[90, 80, 70, 60]`\n* Weights: `[0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3]`\n* Total Weighted Score: `76.00`",
