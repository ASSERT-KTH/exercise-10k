  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) method.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_lcm(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the GCD using the math.gcd function\n    gcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(num1 * num2) // gcd\n    \n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the LCM\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_lcm` function takes two numbers as input and calculates their LCM using the GCD method.\n2. The `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the GCD of the two numbers.\n3. The LCM is calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b)`.\n4. The `main` function gets the two numbers from the user, calculates their LCM using the `calculate_lcm` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the LCM of 12 and 15: `calculate_lcm(12, 15)` returns `60`.\n* Calculate the LCM of 24 and 30: `calculate_lcm(24, 30)` returns `120`.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input numbers are positive integers. If you need to handle negative numbers or non-integer values, you will need to modify the program accordingly.",
