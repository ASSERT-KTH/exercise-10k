  "prompt": "Create a program that uses binary search to find an element in a sorted array. The program should return the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint binary_search(int arr[], int n, int x) {\n    int l = 0;\n    int u = n - 1;\n\n    while (l <= u) {\n        int mid = l + (u - l) / 2;\n\n        if (arr[mid] == x) {\n            return mid;\n        } else if (arr[mid] < x) {\n            l = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            u = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return -1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int x = 50;\n\n    int result = binary_search(arr, n, x);\n\n    if (result == -1) {\n        printf(\"Element not found in array\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Element found at index %d\\n\", result);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis code defines the `binary_search` function, which takes a sorted array `arr`, its size `n`, and a target element `x` as input. It returns the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.\n\nThe `main` function creates a sample array `arr`, sets the target element `x` to 50, and calls the `binary_search` function with these inputs. It then prints the result of the search, either the index of the element or a message indicating that the element was not found.\n\nNote that I've used the `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])` expression to calculate the size of the array `arr`, as this is a common idiom in C programming. I've also used the `int mid = l + (u - l) / 2` expression to calculate the midpoint of the range, as this is a more robust way to calculate the midpoint that avoids potential integer overflow issues.",
