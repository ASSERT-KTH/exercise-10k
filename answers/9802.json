Enter the student's name, age, and grade level.\n3. Select option 4 to display all student records.\n4. Select option 2 to remove a student.\n5. Enter the student's name to remove their record.\n6. Select option 3 to update a student's record.\n7. Enter the student's name and update their information.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple dictionary to store student records, where each record is another dictionary containing the student's name, age, and grade level. The program provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the student records.",
