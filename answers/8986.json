  "answer": "### Removing Duplicate Characters from a String\n#### Function Description\nThe function `remove_duplicates` takes a string as input and returns the string with all duplicate characters removed. This function preserves the original order of characters.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate characters from a string, preserving the original order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with all duplicate characters removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            result.append(char)\n            seen.add(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"hello world\"\n    print(\"Original string:\", input_str)\n    print(\"String without duplicates:\", remove_duplicates(input_str))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. We create an empty set `seen` to keep track of characters we've already encountered.\n2. We iterate through each character in the input string.\n3. If a character is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the result list and the `seen` set.\n4. Finally, we join the characters in the result list into a string and return it.\n\n#### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we're doing a constant amount of work for each character in the string. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all characters are unique), the size of the `seen` set and the result list will be equal to the length of the input string.",
