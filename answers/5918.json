  "answer": "**Character Shift Function**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function takes a string and a shift value as input, and returns the string with each character shifted by the shift value. The shift is circular, meaning that if a character is shifted beyond 'z' or 'Z', it wraps around to 'a' or 'A' respectively.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef shift_string(s, shift):\n    \"\"\"\n    Shifts each character in the string by the given shift value.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n        shift (int): The shift value.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The string with each character shifted by the shift value.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            ascii_offset = 97 if char.islower() else 65\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s = \"Hello, World!\"\n    shift = 3\n    print(f\"Original string: {s}\")\n    print(f\"Shifted string: {shift_string(s, shift)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function iterates over each character in the input string.\n2. If the character is a letter (checked using `isalpha()`), it calculates the new character by shifting the ASCII value of the character by the shift value.\n3. The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII value of a character, and `chr()` is used to get the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n4. The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift is circular, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary.\n5. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result string unchanged.\n6. The function returns the resulting string with all characters shifted by the shift value.\n\n### Note\n\nThis function only shifts letters, leaving other characters (such as punctuation and whitespace) unchanged. If you want to shift all characters, you can modify the function to remove the `isalpha()` check. However, this may not produce the desired results for non-letter characters.",
