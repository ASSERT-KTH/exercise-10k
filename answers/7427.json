  "prompt": "Create a function named 'calculator' that takes in two numbers and an operator as arguments. The function should perform the operation based on the operator and return the result. The operators can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'. If the operator is not one of these, the function should return 'Invalid operator'. If the operator is '/' and the second number is 0, the function should return 'Cannot divide by zero'.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that performs basic arithmetic operations based on the provided operator and returns the result, handling potential errors for invalid operators and division by zero. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculator(num1, num2, operator):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs basic arithmetic operations based on the provided operator.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n        operator (str): The operator to be used for the operation. It can be '+', '-', '*', or '/'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the operation if the operator is valid and the operation is successful.\n        str: 'Invalid operator' if the operator is not one of the four basic arithmetic operators.\n        str: 'Cannot divide by zero' if the operator is '/' and the second number is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the operator is '/' and the second number is 0\n    if operator == '/' and num2 == 0:\n        # If this condition is true, we return 'Cannot divide by zero'\n        return 'Cannot divide by zero'\n\n    # Then, we check if the operator is one of the four basic arithmetic operators\n    if operator not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:\n        # If the operator is not one of these, we return 'Invalid operator'\n        return 'Invalid operator'\n\n    # If the operator is '+', we perform addition and return the result\n    if operator == '+':\n        # We use the built-in '+' operator to perform the addition\n        return num1 + num2\n\n    # If the operator is '-', we perform subtraction and return the result\n    elif operator == '-':\n        # We use the built-in '-' operator to perform the subtraction\n        return num1 - num2\n\n    # If the operator is '*', we perform multiplication and return the result\n    elif operator == '*':\n        # We use the built-in '*' operator to perform the multiplication\n        return num1 * num2\n\n    # If the operator is '/', we perform division and return the result\n    elif operator == '/':\n        # We use the built-in '/' operator to perform the division\n        return num1 / num2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculator` first checks if the `operator` is '/' and the second number `num2` is 0, in which case it returns 'Cannot divide by zero' to prevent a division by zero error.\n* It then checks if the `operator` is one of the four basic arithmetic operators ('+', '-', '*', '/'). If not, it returns 'Invalid operator' to handle invalid input.\n* For valid operators, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation using the built-in operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') and returns the result.\n* The function includes docstrings that provide a description of its purpose, parameters, and return values, making it easier for users to understand how to use the function and what to expect from it.",
