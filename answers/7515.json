  "answer": "**Mad Libs Game**\n================\n\n### Overview\n\nMad Libs is a word game where a story with missing words is given, and players are asked to fill in the blanks with different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.) without knowing the context of the story. This code will create a simple Mad Libs game using Python.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\n# Import the required library\nimport random\n\n# Define a function to get user input\ndef get_user_input(word_type):\n    \"\"\"Get user input for a specific word type\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(f\"Enter a {word_type}: \")\n        if user_input:\n            return user_input\n        else:\n            print(\"Please enter a word.\")\n\n# Define a function to play the game\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play the Mad Libs game\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Mad Libs!\")\n\n    # Get user input for different word types\n    noun = get_user_input(\"noun\")\n    verb = get_user_input(\"verb\")\n    adjective = get_user_input(\"adjective\")\n    place = get_user_input(\"place\")\n    person = get_user_input(\"person\")\n\n    # Define a story with missing words\n    story = f\"One day, a very {adjective} {noun} was walking down the street. \" \\\n            f\"Suddenly, it started to {verb} and ran all the way to the {place}. \" \\\n            f\"There, it met a {person} who was also very {adjective}. \" \\\n            f\"They became fast friends and had many more {adjective} adventures together.\"\n\n    # Print the completed story\n    print(\"\\nHere's your completed story:\")\n    print(story)\n\n# Run the game\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nWhen you run the code, it will prompt you to enter different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.). After you enter all the required words, it will print out a completed story with the words inserted.\n\n```\nWelcome to Mad Libs!\nEnter a noun: cat\nEnter a verb: run\nEnter an adjective: happy\nEnter a place: park\nEnter a person: teacher\n\nHere's your completed story:\nOne day, a very happy cat was walking down the street. Suddenly, it started to run and ran all the way to the park. There, it met a teacher who was also very happy. They became fast friends and had many more happy adventures together.\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* You can modify the story and word types to create different versions of the game.\n* You can also add more features, such as allowing users to save their stories or generating random stories.\n* To make the game more challenging, you can add a time limit for users to enter their words or limit the number of words they can use.",
