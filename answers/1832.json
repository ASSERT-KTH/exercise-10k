  "answer": "**Common Elements Between Two Arrays**\n======================================\n\nThis program finds the common elements between two given arrays using Python.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the common elements between two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        arr1 (list): The first array.\n        arr2 (list): The second array.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The common elements between the two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    arr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    common = common_elements(arr1, arr2)\n    print(\"Common elements:\", common)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The `common_elements` function takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input.\n2. It converts the arrays to sets using the `set()` function.\n3. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the common elements.\n4. The result is converted back to a list using the `list()` function.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `common_elements` function with two example arrays.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nCommon elements: [4, 5]\n```\n\n**Note**\n----\n\n* This program assumes that the arrays only contain hashable elements (e.g., integers, strings). If the arrays contain unhashable elements (e.g., lists, dictionaries), a different approach would be needed.\n* The order of the common elements in the output list is not guaranteed to be the same as their order in the input arrays. If preserving the order is important, a different approach would be needed.",
