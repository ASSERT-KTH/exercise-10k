  "prompt": "Write a program that determines if a person is eligible for a loan based on their income and credit score. If the income is above $50,000 and the credit score is above 600, the person is eligible for a loan. If the income is below $30,000 or the credit score is below 500, the person is not eligible for a loan. If the income and credit score are between these ranges, the person may be eligible for a loan.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that implements the loan eligibility criteria:\n\n```python\ndef determine_loan_eligibility(income, credit_score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on their income and credit score.\n\n    Args:\n        income (float): The person's annual income in dollars.\n        credit_score (int): The person's credit score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A message indicating whether the person is eligible, not eligible, or may be eligible for a loan.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the income is above $50,000 and the credit score is above 600\n    if income > 50000 and credit_score > 600:\n        return \"You are eligible for a loan.\"\n\n    # Check if the income is below $30,000 or the credit score is below 500\n    if income < 30000 or credit_score < 500:\n        return \"You are not eligible for a loan.\"\n\n    # If the income and credit score are between these ranges, the person may be eligible for a loan\n    return \"You may be eligible for a loan. Please contact us for further review.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the person's income and credit score\n    income = float(input(\"Enter your annual income: $\"))\n    credit_score = int(input(\"Enter your credit score: \"))\n\n    # Determine the loan eligibility\n    eligibility_message = determine_loan_eligibility(income, credit_score)\n\n    # Print the eligibility message\n    print(eligibility_message)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The `determine_loan_eligibility` function takes two arguments: `income` and `credit_score`.\n2. It checks the loan eligibility criteria:\n   * If the income is above $50,000 and the credit score is above 600, it returns a message indicating that the person is eligible for a loan.\n   * If the income is below $30,000 or the credit score is below 500, it returns a message indicating that the person is not eligible for a loan.\n   * If the income and credit score are between these ranges, it returns a message indicating that the person may be eligible for a loan.\n3. The `main` function gets the person's income and credit score from the user, determines the loan eligibility using the `determine_loan_eligibility` function, and prints the eligibility message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* A person with an income of $60,000 and a credit score of 700 would be eligible for a loan.\n* A person with an income of $20,000 and a credit score of 400 would not be eligible for a loan.\n* A person with an income of $40,000 and a credit score of 550 may be eligible for a loan.",
