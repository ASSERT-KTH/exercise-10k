  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses a dictionary to store student grades and provides the functionality you requested:\n\n```python\n# student_grades.py\n\ndef add_student(grades):\n    \"\"\"Add a new student to the grades dictionary.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    if name not in grades:\n        grades[name] = []\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' added successfully.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Student '{name}' already exists.\")\n\ndef add_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"Add a grade to an existing student.\"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Enter the student's name: \")\n    if name in grades:\n        while True:\n            try:\n                grade = float(input(\"Enter the grade: \"))\n                if 0 <= grade <= 100:\n                    grades[name].append(grade)\n                    print(f\"Grade '{grade}' added to '{name}' successfully.\")\n                    break\n                else:\n                    print(\"Grade must be between 0 and 100.\")\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input.

The dictionary has student names as keys and a list of grades as values.\n\nThe program provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the `grades` dictionary. The menu options are:\n\n*   Add Student: Allows users to add a new student to the `grades` dictionary.\n*   Add Grade: Enables users to add a grade to an existing student in the `grades` dictionary.\n*   Calculate Average Grade: Calculates the average grade for each student in the `grades` dictionary.\n*   Exit: Exits the program.\n\nThe program uses functions to organize the code and make it more readable. Each function has a specific responsibility, such as adding a student, adding a grade, or calculating the average grade.\n\nThe `main` function serves as the program's entry point and contains the menu-driven interface. It uses a `while` loop to repeatedly display the menu and process user input until the user chooses to exit.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo run the program, save the code in a file called `student_grades.py` and execute it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython student_grades.py\n```\n\nFollow the menu prompts to add students, add grades, and calculate average grades. For example:\n\n*   Add a student named \"John Doe\" by selecting option 1 and entering the name.\n*   Add a grade of 85 to John Doe by selecting option 2, entering the name, and entering the grade.\n*   Calculate the average grade for John Doe by selecting option 3.\n\nThe program will display the average grade for John Doe, which in this case would be 85.00.",
