  "answer": "### Balanced Brackets Function\n#### Overview\nThe following function checks if a given string has balanced brackets. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the closing brackets.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef has_balanced_brackets(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given string has balanced brackets.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the string has balanced brackets, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    bracket_map = {\")\": \"(\", \"}\": \"{\", \"]\": \"[\"}\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char in bracket_map.values():\n            # If the character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in bracket_map.keys():\n            # If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != bracket_map[char]:\n                return False\n\n    # If the stack is empty after iterating over the string, the brackets are balanced\n    return not stack\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(has_balanced_brackets(\"({[]})\"))  # True\n    print(has_balanced_brackets(\"({[})\"))  # False\n    print(has_balanced_brackets(\"({[]\"))  # False\n    print(has_balanced_brackets(\"({}[])\"))  # True\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. We create an empty stack to store the opening brackets.\n2. We define a dictionary `bracket_map` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.\n3. We iterate over each character in the input string.\n4. If the character is an opening bracket, we push it to the stack.\n5. If the character is a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket. If either condition is true, we return False.\n6. After iterating over the string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, the brackets are balanced, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.",
