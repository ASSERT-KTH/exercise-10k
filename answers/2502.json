  "prompt": "Create a program that subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef subtract_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of subtracting num2 from num1.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nresult = subtract_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The result of subtracting {num2} from {num1} is: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we define a function called `subtract_numbers` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`. The function then returns the result of subtracting `num2` from `num1`.\n\nWe then ask the user to input two numbers, convert them to floats, and call our `subtract_numbers` function with these two numbers. Finally, we print the result.\n\nNote: This program will work with both integers and decimals. If you want to restrict it to integers only, you can use `int()` instead of `float()`.",
