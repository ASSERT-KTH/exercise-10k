  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n=====================================================\n\n### Function Implementation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the input numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list cannot be empty\")\n    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):\n        raise TypeError(\"All elements in the list must be numbers\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.\n*   It first checks if the input is a non-empty list and if all elements in the list are numbers. If not, it raises a `TypeError` or `ValueError` accordingly.\n*   The average is calculated by summing up all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.\n*   The function includes docstrings that provide documentation for other developers, including information about the function's parameters, return value, and possible exceptions.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   Always validate the input to your functions to ensure they can handle different scenarios and edge cases.\n*   Use type hints and docstrings to make your code more readable and maintainable.\n*   Consider handling potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of your function.",
