  "answer": "**Calculating the Average Grade**\n=====================================\n\nTo calculate the average grade, we will use the following formula:\n\nAverage Grade = (Sum of all scores) / (Total number of scores)\n\n**Example Code (Python)**\n-------------------------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grade(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average grade given a list of scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (list): A list of scores.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not scores:\n        return 0\n\n    return sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n# Example usage\nscores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]\naverage_grade = calculate_average_grade(scores)\nprint(\"Average Grade:\", average_grade)\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_average_grade` that takes a list of scores as input.\n2. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return 0 as the average grade.\n3. Calculate the sum of all scores using the built-in `sum` function.\n4. Calculate the total number of scores using the built-in `len` function.\n5. Return the average grade by dividing the sum of scores by the total number of scores.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Calculate the average grade of a student in a single subject.\n* Calculate the average grade of a student across multiple subjects.\n* Calculate the average grade of a class or group of students.",
