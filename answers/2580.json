  "answer": "**Last Occurrence of a Character in a String**\n====================================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that finds the last occurrence of a character in a string using a while loop.\n\n```python\ndef last_occurrence(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the last occurrence of the character. Returns -1 if the character is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    index = -1\n    i = len(string) - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        if string[i] == char:\n            index = i\n            break\n        i -= 1\n    return index\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"l\"\n    last_index = last_occurrence(string, char)\n    if last_index != -1:\n        print(f\"The last occurrence of '{char}' in '{string}' is at index {last_index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"'{char}' is not found in '{string}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1. The `last_occurrence` function takes a string and a character as input.\n2. It initializes the `index` variable to -1, which will store the index of the last occurrence of the character.\n3. It starts a while loop from the end of the string (at index `len(string) - 1`) and iterates backwards to the beginning of the string.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character matches the target character. If it does, it updates the `index` variable and breaks out of the loop.\n5. If the loop completes without finding the character, the `index` variable remains -1.\n6. The function returns the `index` variable, which indicates the last occurrence of the character.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nThe last occurrence of 'l' in 'Hello, World!' is at index 9.\n```",
