  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a mortgage amount, interest rate, and loan term as input and calculates the monthly payment. Based on the interest rate, print whether the loan is affordable (less than 30% of gross income) or not.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements. It uses the formula for calculating monthly payments on a fixed-rate loan, which is `M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n \u2013 1]`, where:\n- `M` is your monthly payment.\n- `P` is your principal loan amount.\n- `r` is your monthly interest rate. This is calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 12.\n- `n` is your number of payments. This is calculated by multiplying your number of years by 12.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mortgage_payment(mortgage_amount, interest_rate, loan_term):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the monthly mortgage payment.\n\n    Args:\n        mortgage_amount (float): The amount borrowed.\n        interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n        loan_term (int): The number of years the money is borrowed for.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The monthly payment amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert annual interest rate to monthly interest rate\n    monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 12\n\n    # Calculate the number of payments\n    number_of_payments = loan_term * 12\n\n    # Calculate the monthly payment\n    monthly_payment = (mortgage_amount * monthly_interest_rate * (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** number_of_payments) / (\n                (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** number_of_payments - 1)\n\n    return monthly_payment\n\n\ndef check_affordability(monthly_payment, gross_income):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the loan is affordable based on the monthly payment and gross income.\n\n    Args:\n        monthly_payment (float): The monthly payment amount.\n        gross_income (float): The borrower's gross income.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the loan is affordable, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate 30% of gross income\n    thirty_percent_of_gross_income = gross_income * 0.3\n\n    # Check if the monthly payment is less than 30% of gross income\n    if monthly_payment <= thirty_percent_of_gross_income:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    mortgage_amount = float(input(\"Enter the mortgage amount: $\"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 4 for 4%): \")) / 100\n    loan_term = int(input(\"Enter the loan term in years: \"))\n    gross_income = float(input(\"Enter your gross income: $\"))\n\n    # Calculate the monthly payment\n    monthly_payment = calculate_mortgage_payment(mortgage_amount, interest_rate, loan_term)\n    print(f\"Your monthly payment is: ${monthly_payment:.2f}\")\n\n    # Check if the loan is affordable\n    if check_affordability(monthly_payment, gross_income):\n        print(\"The loan is affordable.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The loan is not affordable.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the mortgage amount, interest rate, loan term, and gross income. The program will then calculate the monthly payment and determine whether the loan is affordable based on the interest rate.",
