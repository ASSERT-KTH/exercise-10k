The program defines a function `calculate_distance` that takes two points as input and returns the Euclidean distance between them.\n2. The `main` function asks the user for the coordinates of two points.\n3. It then calls the `calculate_distance` function with the two points and prints the result.\n4. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: `\u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)`.",
