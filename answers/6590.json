  "answer": "**Median Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the median of all numbers in a given array. The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of all numbers in an array.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The median of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the array in ascending order\n    sorted_array = sorted(array)\n\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(sorted_array)\n\n    # If the array has an odd number of elements, return the middle value\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return sorted_array[n // 2]\n    # If the array has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle values\n    else:\n        mid1 = sorted_array[n // 2 - 1]\n        mid2 = sorted_array[n // 2]\n        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n    median = calculate_median(array)\n    print(f\"The median of the array is: {median}\")\n\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    median = calculate_median(array)\n    print(f\"The median of the array is: {median}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_median` function takes an array as input and returns the median.\n2. The array is sorted in ascending order using the `sorted` function.\n3. The length of the array is calculated using the `len` function.\n4. If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle value is returned.\n5. If the array has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle values is returned.\n6. In the `main` function, example usage is demonstrated with two different arrays.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculating the median of a list of exam scores\n* Finding the median of a dataset in a research study\n* Determining the median of a set of financial transactions\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes that the input array is a list of numbers.\n* The program uses the `sorted` function to sort the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).\n* The program uses the `len` function to calculate the length of the array, which has a time complexity of O(1).",
