  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the common prefix of two lists, i.e., the longest sequence of elements that are equal at the beginning of both lists.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that will find the common prefix of two lists:\n\n```python\ndef common_prefix(list1, list2):\n    prefix = []\n    for a, b in zip(list1, list2):\n        if a == b:\n            prefix.append(a)\n        else:\n            break\n    return prefix\n\n# Test the function\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]\nprint(common_prefix(list1, list2))\n```\n\nThis program works by using the `zip` function to iterate over the two lists in parallel. It appends elements to the `prefix` list as long as the elements at the current position in the two lists are equal. As soon as it encounters a pair of elements that are not equal, it breaks out of the loop and returns the `prefix` list.\n\nPlease note that this function will stop at the end of the shorter list. If you want to get all the common elements from the longer list, you should use the length of the longer list to iterate.\n\nHere's an alternative version of the function that uses list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef common_prefix(list1, list2):\n    return [a for a, b in zip(list1, list2) if a == b]\n\n# Test the function\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]\nprint(common_prefix(list1, list2))\n```\n\nThis version of the function will also stop at the end of the shorter list. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements that are equal in the two input lists.\n\nIn both cases, the output will be `[1, 2, 3]`, which is the common prefix of the two input lists.",
