  "answer": "**Sum of Squares Function**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis function calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of squares of the input numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(n ** 2 for n in numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `sum_of_squares` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to calculate the square of each number in the list.\n3. The built-in `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of these squares.\n4. The result is returned by the function.\n\n### Alternative Implementation\n\nYou can also use the `numpy` library to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sum_of_squares(numbers):\n    return np.sum(np.square(numbers))\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_of_squares(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: 55\n```",
