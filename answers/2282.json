  "answer": "**User Greeting Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program asks the user for their name and then greets them by name.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef greet_user():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for their name and greets them by name.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the program.\n    \"\"\"\n    greet_user()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `greet_user` function uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user for their name.\n2. The user's input is stored in the `name` variable.\n3. The program then uses an f-string to print a greeting message with the user's name.\n4. The `main` function calls `greet_user` to start the program.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only run when the script is executed directly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Save this code in a file named `greet_user.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python: `python greet_user.py`.\n3. When prompted, enter your name.\n4. The program will print a greeting message with your name.",
