  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If it is, the function returns `False`.\n4. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, so the function returns `True`.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Check if 25 is prime: Enter `25` when prompted, and the program will output `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Check if 23 is prime: Enter `23` when prompted, and the program will output `23 is a prime number.`\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program uses a simple trial division method to check if a number is prime. For larger numbers, more efficient algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.\n* The `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` expression is used to calculate the upper bound for the loop, which is the square root of `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.",
