  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that multiplies two matrices:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef multiply_matrices(mat1, mat2):\n    # Get the dimensions of the matrices\n    rows_mat1 = len(mat1)\n    cols_mat1 = len(mat1[0])\n    rows_mat2 = len(mat2)\n    cols_mat2 = len(mat2[0])\n\n    # Check if the matrices can be multiplied\n    if cols_mat1 != rows_mat2:\n        print(\"Matrices cannot be multiplied\")\n        return None\n\n    # Create a new matrix filled with zeros\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_mat2)] for _ in range(rows_mat1)]\n\n    # Multiply the matrices\n    for i in range(rows_mat1):\n        for j in range(cols_mat2):\n            for k in range(cols_mat1):  # or for k in range(rows_mat2)\n                result[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j]\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Example usage\nmatrix1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nmatrix2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]\n\nresult = multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)\n\nif result is not None:\n    print(\"Matrix 1:\")\n    for row in matrix1:\n        print(row)\n    print(\"Matrix 2:\")\n    for row in matrix2:\n        print(row)\n    print(\"Result:\")\n    for row in result:\n        print(row)\n\n\n# Alternatively, you can use numpy's built-in matrix multiplication function\nmatrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nmatrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n\nresult = np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)\n\nprint(\"Matrix 1:\")\nprint(matrix1)\nprint(\"Matrix 2:\")\nprint(matrix2)\nprint(\"Result:\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe program first checks if the matrices can be multiplied by comparing the number of columns in the first matrix with the number of rows in the second matrix. If they are not equal, it prints an error message and returns `None`.\n\nThen, it creates a new matrix filled with zeros, with the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix.\n\nThe program then multiplies the matrices using three nested loops. The outer two loops iterate over the rows and columns of the result matrix, and the inner loop iterates over the columns of the first matrix (or the rows of the second matrix).\n\nFinally, the program prints the result matrix.\n\nAlternatively, you can use numpy's built-in `matmul` function to multiply the matrices, which is more efficient and easier to use.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the matrix multiplication algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the number of rows (or columns) of the matrices. This is because the algorithm uses three nested loops, each of which iterates over the rows or columns of the matrices.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) of the matrices. This is because the algorithm creates a new matrix to store the result, which has the same number of rows and columns as the input matrices.",
