  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and outputs the distance between them.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\nimport math\n\n# Get the coordinates of the two points from the user\nx1, y1 = map(float, input(\"Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1, y1): \").split(','))\nx2, y2 = map(float, input(\"Enter the coordinates of the second point (x2, y2): \").split(','))\n\n# Calculate the differences between the corresponding coordinates\ndx = x2 - x1\ndy = y2 - y1\n\n# Calculate the distance between the two points using the distance formula\ndistance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The distance between the two points is:\", distance)\n\n# Example usage\n# Input: (2, 2), (4, 4)\n# Output: The distance between the two points is: 2.8284271247461903\n```\nNote that I used the `map` function to convert the input strings to floats, and then split the input strings into two coordinates using the `split` method with a comma (`,`) as the separator. I also used the `**` operator to square the differences `dx` and `dy`.",
