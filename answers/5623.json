  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy of the input list to avoid modifying it in-place\n    nums_copy = nums.copy()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(nums_copy)\n\n    # Iterate over the list n-1 times\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made in the current iteration\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate over the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if nums_copy[j] > nums_copy[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                nums_copy[j], nums_copy[j + 1] = nums_copy[j + 1], nums_copy[j]\n                # Set the flag to True\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the current iteration, the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return nums_copy\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n*   The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new sorted list.\n*   The function creates a copy of the input list to avoid modifying it in-place.\n*   It then iterates over the list `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the list.\n*   In each iteration, the function compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n*   The function uses a flag `swapped` to track if any swaps were made in the current iteration. If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted, and the function can exit early.\n*   Finally, the function returns the sorted list.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n\n*   The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case, making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort for large lists.\n*   However, bubble sort can be useful for small lists or educational purposes due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.",
