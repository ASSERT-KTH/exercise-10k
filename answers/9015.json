  "answer": "**Processing a List of Numbers with Map, Filter, and Reduce**\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that utilizes the map, filter, and reduce functions from the functools module to process a list of numbers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef process_numbers(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function processes a list of numbers by squaring even numbers, \n    filtering out odd numbers, and then summing up the remaining numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of the squares of even numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use map to square each number in the list\n    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n\n    # Use filter to keep only even numbers\n    even_squares = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, squared_numbers))\n\n    # Use reduce to sum up the remaining numbers\n    sum_of_even_squares = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, even_squares, 0)\n\n    return sum_of_even_squares\n\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = process_numbers(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of squares of even numbers:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Map**: The map function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a list of the results. In this case, it is used to square each number in the list.\n2. **Filter**: The filter function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True. Here, it is used to filter out odd numbers from the list of squared numbers.\n3. **Reduce**: The reduce function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the elements of a sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single output value. In this example, it is used to sum up the remaining even numbers.\n\nThis code provides a concise and efficient way to process a list of numbers using these three important functions from functional programming.",
