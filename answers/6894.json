  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades. The function should calculate the average grade for each student and return a new dictionary with the average grades.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a function that calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary and returns a new dictionary with these average grades. This will help you understand how to process and analyze student grade data effectively. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average_grades(grades_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average grade for each student in a given dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        grades_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A new dictionary with the average grades for each student.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the average grades\n    average_grades = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each student in the grades dictionary\n    for student, grades in grades_dict.items():\n        # Check if the list of grades is not empty\n        if len(grades) > 0:\n            # Calculate the sum of all grades\n            total_grade = sum(grades)\n            \n            # Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum by the number of grades\n            average_grade = total_grade / len(grades)\n            \n            # Store the average grade in the average_grades dictionary\n            average_grades[student] = average_grade\n        else:\n            # If the list of grades is empty, store None as the average grade\n            average_grades[student] = None\n\n    # Return the dictionary with the average grades\n    return average_grades\n\n# Example usage:\ngrades = {\n    'John': [90, 85, 95],\n    'Alice': [88, 92, 89],\n    'Bob': []\n}\n\nprint(calculate_average_grades(grades))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_average_grades` takes a dictionary `grades_dict` as input, where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades. It initializes an empty dictionary `average_grades` to store the calculated average grades for each student.\n* It iterates over each student in `grades_dict`, checks if the list of grades is not empty, and calculates the average grade by summing all grades using `sum(grades)` and dividing by the number of grades `len(grades)`.\n* The calculated average grade for each student is stored in the `average_grades` dictionary. If a student has no grades (i.e., an empty list), the function stores `None` as their average grade.\n* Finally, the function returns the `average_grades` dictionary, providing the average grades for all students.",
