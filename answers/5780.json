  "answer": "**Discount Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the discount amount based on the total cost and discount percentage.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_discount(total_cost, discount_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the discount amount based on the total cost and discount percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        total_cost (float): The total cost of the item.\n        discount_percentage (float): The discount percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The discount amount.\n    \"\"\"\n    discount_amount = (total_cost / 100) * discount_percentage\n    return discount_amount\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the total cost and discount percentage from the user\n    total_cost = float(input(\"Enter the total cost: $\"))\n    discount_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage (%): \"))\n\n    # Calculate the discount amount\n    discount_amount = calculate_discount(total_cost, discount_percentage)\n\n    # Calculate the final cost after discount\n    final_cost = total_cost - discount_amount\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Discount Percentage: {discount_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Discount Amount: ${discount_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Final Cost: ${final_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the total cost when prompted (e.g., `100`).\n3. Enter the discount percentage when prompted (e.g., `20`).\n4. The program will calculate and display the discount amount, final cost, and other relevant information.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_discount` function takes the total cost and discount percentage as input and returns the discount amount.\n2. The `main` function gets the total cost and discount percentage from the user, calculates the discount amount using the `calculate_discount` function, and prints the results.\n3. The program uses floating-point numbers to handle decimal values and formats the output to display two decimal places.",
