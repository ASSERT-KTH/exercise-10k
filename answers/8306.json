  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input and performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then output the results of these operations.",
  "answer": "Here is the code based on the specifications you provided:\n\n```python\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nprint(\"Addition: \", num1 + num2)\nprint(\"Subtraction: \", num1 - num2)\nprint(\"Multiplication: \", num1 * num2)\nprint(\"Division: \", num1 / num2)\n```\n\nThis code takes two numbers as input from the user, performs the four basic arithmetic operations, and prints the results. It does not handle the division by zero case. If you want to handle this case, you can modify the code as follows:\n\n```python\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\nprint(\"Addition: \", num1 + num2)\nprint(\"Subtraction: \", num1 - num2)\nprint(\"Multiplication: \", num1 * num2)\n\nif num2 != 0:\n    print(\"Division: \", num1 / num2)\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n```",
