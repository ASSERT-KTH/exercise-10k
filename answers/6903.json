The program should then calculate the average grade for each student and store it in the dictionary.

Run the program and choose option 1 to add a student.\n2.  Enter the student's name and grades when prompted.\n3.  The program will calculate the average grade and store it in the student's dictionary.\n4.  Choose option 2 to print all students and verify that the student's information is displayed correctly.\n5.  Choose option 3 to exit the program.",
