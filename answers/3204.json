  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and prints its area and perimeter.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef area(l, w):\n    return l * w\n\n# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle\ndef perimeter(l, w):\n    return 2 * (l + w)\n\n# Main program\nl = int(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\nw = int(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n\n# Calculate the area and perimeter\na = area(l, w)\np = perimeter(l, w)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"The area of the rectangle is: {a}\")\nprint(f\"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {p}\")\n```\nI've followed the specifications carefully, defining the two functions `area` and `perimeter`, and implementing the main program to read the length and width from the user, calculate the area and perimeter, and print the results.",
