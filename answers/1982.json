  "answer": "**Grade Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates a student's grade based on their score using if/else statements. The grade is determined by the following criteria:\n\n* A: 90-100\n* B: 80-89\n* C: 70-79\n* D: 60-69\n* F: Below 60\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a student's grade based on their score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (float): The student's score.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The student's grade.\n    \"\"\"\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the student's score from the user\n    score = float(input(\"Enter the student's score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n\n    # Print the grade\n    print(f\"The student's grade is: {grade}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters a score of 92, the program will output: `The student's grade is: A`\n* If the user enters a score of 75, the program will output: `The student's grade is: C`\n* If the user enters a score of 40, the program will output: `The student's grade is: F`\n\n### How to Run the Program\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `grade_calculator.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3.
