  "answer": "**Squares of Numbers Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program prints a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 to the screen.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_squares(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a list of squares of numbers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n    print(squares)\n\ndef main():\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"Squares of numbers from 1 to {n}:\")\n    print_squares(n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `print_squares` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses a list comprehension to generate a list of squares of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n* The `main` function sets `n` to 10 and calls `print_squares` to print the list of squares.\n* The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nSquares of numbers from 1 to 10:\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code to a file (e.g., `squares.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python squares.py`). The program will print the list of squares to the screen.",
