  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and returns its area.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers.\")\n\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    return area\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and height from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n\n    try:\n        area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)\n        print(f\"The area of the triangle is {area:.2f} square units.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_triangle_area` function takes two arguments: `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * base * height`.\n*   The function checks if the base and height are positive numbers, raising a `ValueError` if either is not.\n*   The `main` function gets the base and height from the user, calls `calculate_triangle_area`, and prints the result.\n*   If a `ValueError` is raised, the error message is caught and printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter `5` as the base and `6` as the height to get an area of `15.00` square units.\n*   Enter `10` as the base and `20` as the height to get an area of `100.00` square units.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `triangle_area.py`), then run it using Python (e.g., `python triangle_area.py`). Follow the prompts to enter the base and height, and the program will print the area of the triangle.",
