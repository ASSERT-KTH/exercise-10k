  "answer": "**Finding the Index of the First Occurrence of a Character in a String**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function, `find_char_index`, takes a string and a character as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string. If the character is not found, it returns -1.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_char_index(string, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first occurrence of a character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        char (str): The character to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the character, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return string.index(char)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    string = \"Hello, World!\"\n    char = \"W\"\n    index = find_char_index(string, char)\n    \n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is found at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The character '{char}' is not found in the string.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `find_char_index` uses the built-in `index` method of Python strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.\n*   If the character is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught and handled by returning -1.\n*   In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use `find_char_index` with a sample string and character. The result is printed to the console.",
