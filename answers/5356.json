  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements from the sublists in the order they appeared. This will help you understand how to approach similar problems in the future. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of lists as input, and returns a new list containing \n    all elements from the sublists, in the order they appeared in the input list.\n\n    Args:\n        nested_list (list): A list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all elements from the sublists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in nested_list:\n        # Iterate over each element in the current sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # Append the current element to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nprint(flatten_list(nested_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `flatten_list` is defined with a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list of lists. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the flattened elements.\n*   The function uses nested loops to iterate over each `sublist` in `nested_list` and then over each `element` in the `sublist`. Each `element` is appended to the `result` list.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all elements from the sublists in the order they appeared.\n*   An example usage is provided to demonstrate how to use the `flatten_list` function with a sample `nested_list` and print the resulting flattened list.",
