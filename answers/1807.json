  "answer": "Here's a Python program using the Tkinter library that draws different shapes on a canvas based on a shape type variable.\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef draw_shape(canvas, shape_type, x, y, size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Draws a shape on the canvas based on the shape type.\n    \n    Args:\n        canvas (tkinter.Canvas): The canvas to draw on.\n        shape_type (str): The type of shape to draw. Can be 'circle', 'square', 'triangle', or 'rectangle'.\n        x (int): The x-coordinate of the shape.\n        y (int): The y-coordinate of the shape.\n        size (int): The size of the shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    if shape_type == 'circle':\n        # Draw a circle\n        canvas.create_oval(x, y, x + size, y + size)\n    elif shape_type == 'square':\n        # Draw a square\n        canvas.create_rectangle(x, y, x + size, y + size)\n    elif shape_type == 'triangle':\n        # Draw a triangle\n        canvas.create_polygon(x, y + size, x + size / 2, y, x + size, y + size)\n    elif shape_type == 'rectangle':\n        # Draw a rectangle\n        canvas.create_rectangle(x, y, x + size * 2, y + size)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid shape type\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a new Tkinter window\n    window = tk.Tk()\n    window.title(\"Shape Drawer\")\n    \n    # Create a new canvas\n    canvas = tk.Canvas(window, width=800, height=600)\n    canvas.pack()\n    \n    # Draw shapes\n    draw_shape(canvas, 'circle', 50, 50, 100)\n    draw_shape(canvas, 'square', 200, 50, 100)\n    draw_shape(canvas, 'triangle', 350, 50, 100)\n    draw_shape(canvas, 'rectangle', 50, 200, 100)\n    \n    # Start the Tkinter event loop\n    window.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program creates a new Tkinter window with a canvas and draws different shapes on it based on a shape type variable. The `draw_shape` function takes in a canvas, shape type, x and y coordinates, and a size, and uses conditional statements to determine which shape to draw. The `main` function creates a new Tkinter window, creates a new canvas, and calls the `draw_shape` function to draw different shapes.",
