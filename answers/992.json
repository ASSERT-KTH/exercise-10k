  "answer": "Here's an example of a program that manages a bank account using Python:\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount. Please enter a positive number.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        print(f\"Current balance is ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter deposit amount: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter withdrawal amount: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program uses a `BankAccount` class to manage the account balance and provide methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking the balance. The `main` function provides a simple menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program.\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The program creates a `BankAccount` object with an initial balance of 0.\n2. The user is presented with a menu to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit the program.\n3. Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding action:\n\t* Deposit: Prompts the user for a deposit amount and updates the balance if the amount is positive.\n\t* Withdraw: Prompts the user for a withdrawal amount and updates the balance if the amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance.\n\t* Check Balance: Displays the current balance.\n\t* Exit: Exits the program.\n4. The program uses if-else statements to validate user input and ensure that transactions are valid.\n\n### Example use cases\n\n1. Deposit $100:\n\t* User chooses option 1 (Deposit) and enters $100.\n\t* Program updates balance to $100 and displays new balance.\n2. Withdraw $50:\n\t* User chooses option 2 (Withdraw) and enters $50.\n\t* Program updates balance to $50 and displays new balance.\n3. Check Balance:\n\t* User chooses option 3 (Check Balance).\n\t* Program displays current balance ($50).",
