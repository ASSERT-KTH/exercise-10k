  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n\n### Description\nThis program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is higher or lower than the number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of attempts\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is in the correct range\n        if user_guess < 1 or user_guess > 100:\n            print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of attempts\n        attempts += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess == number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} attempts.\".format(attempts))\n            break\n        elif user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Your guess is too low.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Your guess is too high.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### How to Run\nTo run this program, save it to a file called `guessing_game.py`, then run it with Python:\n```bash\npython guessing_game.py\n```\n\n### Example Usage\nWhen you run the program, it will generate a random number and prompt you to guess it. After each guess, it will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the number. You can keep guessing until you find the correct number, or type \"quit\" to give up. For example:\n```\nWelcome to the number guessing game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nTake a guess: 50\nYour guess is too low.\nTake a guess: 75\nYour guess is too high.\nTake a guess: 67\nCongratulations! You found the number in 3 attempts.\n```",
