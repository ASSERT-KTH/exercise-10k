  "answer": "**Set Operations Program**\n================================\n\nThis program performs a given set operation on two sets. It supports the following operations:\n\n* Union\n* Intersection\n* Difference\n* Symmetric Difference\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef perform_set_operation(set1, set2, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a set operation on two sets.\n\n    Args:\n        set1 (set): The first set.\n        set2 (set): The second set.\n        operation (str): The set operation to perform. Can be 'union', 'intersection', 'difference', or 'symmetric_difference'.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: The result of the set operation.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the operation is not one of the supported operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'union':\n        return set1.union(set2)\n    elif operation == 'intersection':\n        return set1.intersection(set2)\n    elif operation == 'difference':\n        return set1.difference(set2)\n    elif operation == 'symmetric_difference':\n        return set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Supported operations are 'union', 'intersection', 'difference', and 'symmetric_difference'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n    set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    operations = {\n        'union': 'Union',\n        'intersection': 'Intersection',\n        'difference': 'Difference',\n        'symmetric_difference': 'Symmetric Difference'\n    }\n\n    for operation, name in operations.items():\n        result = perform_set_operation(set1, set2, operation)\n        print(f\"{name}: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `perform_set_operation` function takes two sets and an operation as input.\n2. It uses the built-in set methods to perform the specified operation.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `perform_set_operation` function with example sets and operations.\n4. The program prints the results of each operation.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nUnion: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nIntersection: {3, 4}\nDifference: {1, 2}\nSymmetric Difference: {1, 2, 5, 6}\n```",
