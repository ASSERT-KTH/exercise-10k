  "answer": "**Student Greeting Program**\n================================\n\n### Code\n```python\n# Declare variables to store a student's name and age\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print out a greeting message with the student's name and age\nprint(f\"Hello, my name is {student_name} and I am {student_age} years old.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. We declare two variables: `student_name` to store the student's name and `student_age` to store the student's age.\n2. We use an f-string to print out a greeting message that includes the student's name and age.\n3. The `f` prefix before the string literal indicates that it's an f-string, which allows us to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.\n\n### Example Output\n```\nHello, my name is John Doe and I am 20 years old.\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to see the output. Simply copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., `student_greeting.py`) and run it using `python student_greeting.py`.",
