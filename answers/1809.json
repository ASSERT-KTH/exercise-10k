  "prompt": "Write a program that scores a quiz based on user answers, using conditional statements to determine the correct answers",
  "answer": "Here's a simple quiz program written in Python. The quiz has 5 questions, and the user's score is determined by their answers.\n\n```python\n# Define the quiz questions and answers\nquiz_questions = {\n    \"What is the capital of France?\": \"Paris\",\n    \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\": \"Jupiter\",\n    \"Which programming language is this quiz written in?\": \"Python\",\n    \"What is the largest mammal?\": \"Blue whale\",\n    \"What is the chemical symbol for gold?\": \"Au\"\n}\n\ndef quiz():\n    # Initialize the score\n    score = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the quiz questions\n    for question, answer in quiz_questions.items():\n        # Ask the user for their answer\n        user_answer = input(question + \" \")\n\n        # Check if the user's answer is correct\n        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():\n            print(\"Correct!\\n\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {answer}.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final score\n    print(f\"Quiz complete! Your final score is {score} out of {len(quiz_questions)}.\")\n\n# Start the quiz\nquiz()\n```\n\nThis program works by defining a dictionary where the keys are the quiz questions and the values are the correct answers. It then iterates over these questions, asking the user for their answer and checking if it matches the correct answer. If the user's answer is correct, it increments their score and prints a success message. If the user's answer is incorrect, it prints an error message with the correct answer. Finally, it prints the user's final score.\n\nNote that this program uses the `lower()` method to make the quiz case-insensitive, so the user can enter their answers in any case (e.g., \"Paris\", \"PARIS\", \"paris\", etc.) and it will still be considered correct.",
