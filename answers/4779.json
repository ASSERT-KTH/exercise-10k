  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates a student's GPA based on their grades. If the grade is 'A', the GPA is 4.0. If the grade is 'B', the GPA is 3.0. If the grade is 'C', the GPA is 2.0. If the grade is 'D', the GPA is 1.0. If the grade is 'F', the GPA is 0.0.",

Define a function `calculate_gpa` that takes a list of grades as input and returns the calculated GPA.\n2.  Within the function, define a dictionary `gpa_map` that maps each grade to its corresponding GPA.\n3.  Initialize variables `total_gpa` and `count` to keep track of the total GPA and the number of grades, respectively.\n4.  Iterate over each grade in the input list. For each grade, check if it's valid by looking it up in the `gpa_map`. If it's valid, add its corresponding GPA to `total_gpa` and increment the `count`.\n5.  If there are no valid grades, return a GPA of 0. Otherwise, calculate the average GPA by dividing `total_gpa` by `count`.\n6.  In the `main` function, demonstrate how to use the `calculate_gpa` function with an example list of grades and print the calculated GPA.",
