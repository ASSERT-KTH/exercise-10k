  "answer": "### Dictionary Subset Checker\n\nThis program checks if one dictionary is a subset of another. A dictionary is considered a subset if all its key-value pairs are present in the other dictionary.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_subset(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if dict1 is a subset of dict2.\n    \n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The dictionary to check.\n        dict2 (dict): The dictionary to check against.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if dict1 is a subset of dict2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return all(key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value for key, value in dict1.items())\n\ndef main():\n    # Example dictionaries\n    city_populations1 = {\n        \"New York\": 8537673,\n        \"Los Angeles\": 3990456,\n        \"Chicago\": 2720546\n    }\n    \n    city_populations2 = {\n        \"New York\": 8537673,\n        \"Los Angeles\": 3990456,\n        \"Chicago\": 2720546,\n        \"Houston\": 2319092\n    }\n    \n    # Check if city_populations1 is a subset of city_populations2\n    result = is_subset(city_populations1, city_populations2)\n    print(f\"Is city_populations1 a subset of city_populations2? {result}\")\n    \n    # Check if city_populations2 is a subset of city_populations1\n    result = is_subset(city_populations2, city_populations1)\n    print(f\"Is city_populations2 a subset of city_populations1? {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_subset` function takes two dictionaries as arguments.\n2. It uses the `all` function with a generator expression to check if all key-value pairs in `dict1` are present in `dict2`.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of `is_subset` with two example dictionaries.\n4. The program prints the result of the subset check for both directions.\n\n#### Output\n\n```\nIs city_populations1 a subset of city_populations2? True\nIs city_populations2 a subset of city_populations1? False\n```",
