  "answer": "**Age Calculator Program**\n==========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates a person's age based on their birth year using if/else statements. It takes the birth year as input from the user and calculates the age based on the current year.\n\n### Code\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n\ndef calculate_age(birth_year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a person's age based on their birth year.\n    \n    Args:\n        birth_year (int): The person's birth year.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The person's age.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_year = date.today().year\n    \n    if birth_year > current_year:\n        print(\"Birth year cannot be greater than the current year.\")\n        return None\n    else:\n        age = current_year - birth_year\n        return age\n\ndef main():\n    birth_year = int(input(\"Enter your birth year: \"))\n    age = calculate_age(birth_year)\n    \n    if age is not None:\n        print(f\"Your age is: {age} years old\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_age` function takes the birth year as input and calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.\n2. The function checks if the birth year is greater than the current year. If true, it prints an error message and returns `None`.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to enter their birth year, calls the `calculate_age` function, and prints the calculated age.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter your birth year when prompted.\n2. The program will calculate and print your age based on your birth year.\n\n**Note:** This program assumes that the user will enter a valid birth year. You may want to add additional error handling to handle invalid inputs.",
