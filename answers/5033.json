  "answer": "Here is a Python program that removes duplicates from a given list of numbers using for loops:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): The list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The list of numbers with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_list = []\n    for num in num_list:\n        found = False\n        for unique_num in unique_list:\n            if num == unique_num:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if not found:\n            unique_list.append(num)\n    return unique_list\n\n\ndef main():\n    num_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]\n    print(\"Original list: \", num_list)\n    unique_list = remove_duplicates(num_list)\n    print(\"List after removing duplicates: \", unique_list)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `remove_duplicates` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with duplicates removed.\n*   It iterates through each number in the input list.\n*   For each number, it checks if the number already exists in the `unique_list` by iterating through the `unique_list`.\n*   If the number is not found in the `unique_list`, it is appended to the `unique_list`.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `remove_duplicates` function with a sample list of numbers.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Removing duplicate numbers from a list of exam scores.\n*   Eliminating duplicate IDs from a list of user IDs.\n*   Removing duplicate values from a list of sensor readings.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because for each element in the input list, the program potentially iterates through the entire `unique_list`. This is not the most efficient approach, especially for large input lists. A more efficient approach would be to use a set or dictionary to keep track of unique elements, which would have a time complexity of O(n).",
