  "answer": "### Dictionary Difference Function\n#### Overview\nThis function calculates the difference between two dictionaries. It returns a dictionary containing the keys and values that are unique to either dictionary.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef dict_diff(dict1, dict2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.\n        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the keys and values that are unique to either dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    diff = {}\n    all_keys = set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())\n\n    for key in all_keys:\n        if key not in dict1:\n            diff[key] = dict2[key]\n        elif key not in dict2:\n            diff[key] = dict1[key]\n        elif dict1[key] != dict2[key]:\n            diff[key] = {'dict1': dict1[key], 'dict2': dict2[key]}\n\n    return diff\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n    dict2 = {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'd': 5}\n\n    print(dict_diff(dict1, dict2))\n    # Output: {'a': 1, 'c': {'dict1': 3, 'dict2': 4}, 'd': 5}\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function `dict_diff` takes two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` as input.\n2. It calculates the union of the keys from both dictionaries using the `set` data structure.\n3. It then iterates over all unique keys.\n4. If a key is present in only one dictionary, it adds the key-value pair to the `diff` dictionary.\n5. If a key is present in both dictionaries but has different values, it adds the key to the `diff` dictionary with a nested dictionary containing the values from both dictionaries.\n6. Finally, it returns the `diff` dictionary containing the differences between the two input dictionaries.",
