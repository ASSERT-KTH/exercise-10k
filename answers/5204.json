  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers provided by the user:\n\n```python\ndef get_numbers_from_user():\n    \"\"\"Get a list of numbers from the user.\"\"\"\n    numbers = []\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'done':\n            break\n        try:\n            number = float(user_input)\n            numbers.append(number)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number or 'done' to finish.\")\n    return numbers\n\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return None\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the average calculator!\")\n    numbers = get_numbers_from_user()\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        print(\"No numbers entered. Cannot calculate average.\")\n    else:\n        average = calculate_average(numbers)\n        print(f\"You entered: {numbers}\")\n        print(f\"The average is: {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The `get_numbers_from_user` function asks the user to enter numbers one by one. The user can enter 'done' to finish entering numbers.\n2. The `calculate_average` function calculates the average of a list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n3. The `main` function calls the above two functions and prints the result.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nWhen you run this program, it will ask you to enter numbers one by one. After you enter 'done', it will calculate and print the average of the numbers you entered.\n\n```\nWelcome to the average calculator!\nEnter a number (or 'done' to finish): 10\nEnter a number (or 'done' to finish): 20\nEnter a number (or 'done' to finish): 30\nEnter a number (or 'done' to finish): done\nYou entered: [10.0, 20.0, 30.0]\nThe average is: 20.0\n```\n\nNote: This program uses `float` to allow the user to enter decimal numbers. If you want to restrict the input to integers only, you can use `int` instead.",
