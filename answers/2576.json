  "answer": "**Calculating Average of Array Elements using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the average of numbers in an array using a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of numbers in an array.\n\n    Args:\n    array (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average of the numbers in the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in array:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(array)\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"The average of the numbers is: \", average)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_average` function takes an array as an input.\n*   It initializes a `total` variable to store the sum of all numbers in the array.\n*   The function then uses a for loop to iterate over each number in the array, adding it to the `total`.\n*   Finally, it returns the average by dividing the `total` by the length of the array.\n*   In the example usage, we create an array of numbers and pass it to the `calculate_average` function to calculate and print the average.\n\n### Note\n\n*   This program assumes that the input array is not empty. If the array is empty, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to calculate the average.\n*   To handle this edge case, you can add a check at the beginning of the `calculate_average` function to return a default value (e.g., None or a specific error message) when the array is empty.",
