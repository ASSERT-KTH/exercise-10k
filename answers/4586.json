  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers**\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function, `calculate_average`, takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average value.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average value of the input list.\n\n    Raises:\n        ZeroDivisionError: If the input list is empty.\n        TypeError: If the input is not a list or contains non-numeric values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")\n    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):\n        raise TypeError(\"All elements in the list must be numbers\")\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot calculate average of an empty list\")\n\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function first checks if the input is a list and if all elements in the list are numbers.\n2. It then checks if the list is empty. If it is, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised because the average of an empty list is undefined.\n3. The average is calculated by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.\n4. The function returns the calculated average.\n5. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a list of numbers and print the result.",
