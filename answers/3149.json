  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Function**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis function checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    numbers_to_check = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    for num in numbers_to_check:\n        print(f\"{num} is prime: {is_prime(num)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3. The function then checks for divisors from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n4. If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(\u221an), which is much more efficient than checking all the way up to `n`. This is because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.",
