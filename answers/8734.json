  "answer": "### Declaring and Using Set Variables\n#### Overview\nSets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for storing data without duplicates and for performing mathematical operations such as union, intersection, and difference.\n\n#### Declaring Set Variables\nSets can be declared using the `set` keyword in Python.\n\n```python\n# Declare an empty set\nempty_set = set()\n\n# Declare a set with initial elements\nfruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"}\n```\n\n#### Using Set Variables\nSets support various operations and methods, including:\n\n*   Adding elements: `add()`, `update()`\n*   Removing elements: `remove()`, `discard()`, `pop()`\n*   Mathematical operations: `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`, `symmetric_difference()`\n*   Checking membership: `in`\n\n```python\n# Add an element to the set\nfruits.add(\"grape\")\n\n# Remove an element from the set\nfruits.remove(\"banana\")\n\n# Perform mathematical operations\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {3, 4, 5}\nprint(set1.union(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nprint(set1.intersection(set2))  # Output: {3}\nprint(set1.difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2}\nprint(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\n# Check membership\nprint(\"apple\" in fruits)  # Output: True\n```\n\n#### Example Use Case\nHere's an example use case that demonstrates how to use sets to find unique words in a sentence:\n\n```python\ndef find_unique_words(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    unique_words = set(words)\n    return unique_words\n\nsentence = \"This is a test sentence and this sentence is just a test\"\nprint(find_unique_words(sentence))\n```\n\nThis code splits the sentence into words, adds them to a set, and returns the set of unique words.\n\n### Best Practices\nWhen working with sets, keep the following best practices in mind:\n\n*   Use sets when you need to store a collection of unique elements.\n*   Use the `add()` method to add single elements to a set.\n*   Use the `update()` method to add multiple elements to a set.\n*   Use the `remove()` method to remove elements from a set.\n*   Use the `in` operator to check membership in a set.\n*   Be aware that sets are unordered, so you cannot access elements by index.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using sets effectively, you can write more efficient and readable code.",
