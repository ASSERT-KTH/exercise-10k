  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list.\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(num_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        num_list (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_sum = sum(num for num in num_list if num % 2 == 0)\n    return even_sum\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    print(\"Input List:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Sum of even numbers:\", sum_even_numbers(numbers))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works:**\n\n1. The `sum_even_numbers` function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each number in the list.\n3. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division by 2 is 0, the number is even.\n4. The `sum` function adds up all the even numbers.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sum_even_numbers` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nInput List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nSum of even numbers: 30\n```",
