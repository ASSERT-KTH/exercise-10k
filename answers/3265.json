  "answer": "Here's a Python program that uses nested for loops to print out a pattern of asterisks in the shape of a square:\n\n```python\ndef print_square(size):\n    # Iterate over the rows of the square\n    for i in range(size):\n        # Iterate over the columns of the square\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Print an asterisk for each position in the square\n            print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n        # Print a newline after each row\n        print()\n\n# Test the function with a square of size 5\nprint_square(5)\n```\n\nIn this program, `print_square(size)` is a function that takes one argument, `size`, which represents the number of rows (and columns) in the square.\n\nThe outer loop `for i in range(size):` iterates over the rows of the square. For each row, the inner loop `for j in range(size):` iterates over the columns. Inside the inner loop, `print(\"*\", end=\" \")` prints an asterisk for each position in the square, without starting a new line. Finally, `print()` after the inner loop prints a newline after each row, moving to the next line for the next row of the square.\n\nWhen you run `print_square(5)`, it will print a 5x5 square of asterisks, like this:\n```\n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n* * * * * \n```",
