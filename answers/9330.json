  "prompt": "Write a program to perform various operations using variables, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\n\n# Addition\naddition = num1 + num2\nprint(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition}\")\n\n# Subtraction\nsubtraction = num1 - num2\nprint(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction}\")\n\n# Multiplication\nmultiplication = num1 * num2\nprint(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication}\")\n\n# Division\nif num2 != 0:\n    division = num1 / num2\n    print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\n# Ask user for input\ndef get_user_input():\n    try:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n        return num1, num2\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n        return get_user_input()\n\n# Perform operations with user input\ndef perform_operations():\n    num1, num2 = get_user_input()\n    print(\"\\nOperations:\")\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n    if num2 != 0:\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"---------------------\")\n    print(\"Example with predefined numbers:\")\n    num1 = 10\n    num2 = 2\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n    if num2 != 0:\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    print(\"\\nNow, let's perform operations with user input.\")\n    perform_operations()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Predefined Numbers**: The code starts with predefined numbers `num1` and `num2` and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n2.  **User Input**: The `get_user_input` function asks the user to input two numbers and returns them. It includes error handling to ensure that the input is a valid number.\n3.  **Perform Operations**: The `perform_operations` function uses the user-input numbers to perform the arithmetic operations and prints the results.\n4.  **Main Function**: The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the operations with predefined numbers and then prompts the user to input numbers for further calculations.\n\n### Advice:\n\n*   Always handle potential errors, such as division by zero, to prevent program crashes.\n*   Use functions to organize code and make it more readable and maintainable.\n*   Implement input validation to ensure that user input is valid and can be processed correctly.",
