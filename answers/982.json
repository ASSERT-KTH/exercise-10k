  "prompt": "Create a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The user inputs their choice, and the program generates a random choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Generate a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on the game's rules.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return 'Tie'\n    elif (user_choice == 'Rock' and computer_choice == 'Scissors') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'Paper' and computer_choice == 'Rock') or \\\n         (user_choice == 'Scissors' and computer_choice == 'Paper'):\n        return 'User'\n    else:\n        return 'Computer'\n\ndef play_game():\n    \"\"\"Play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    while True:\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: \")\n        if user_choice.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        user_choice = user_choice.capitalize()\n        if user_choice not in ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n        print(f\"\\nUser chose: {user_choice}\")\n        print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n        winner = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n        if winner == 'Tie':\n            print(f\"It's a tie!\")\n        elif winner == 'User':\n            print(f\"{user_choice} beats {computer_choice}. You win!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{computer_choice} beats {user_choice}. Computer wins!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    play_game()\n```\nThis program uses a simple text-based interface to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer, and the `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the game's rules. The `play_game` function controls the game flow and handles user input.\n\nExample usage:\n```\nWelcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: Rock\n\nUser chose: Rock\nComputer chose: Scissors\n\nRock beats Scissors. You win!\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: Paper\n\nUser chose: Paper\nComputer chose: Paper\n\nIt's a tie!\nEnter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors), or 'q' to quit: q\n```",
