  "answer": "**Perfect Square Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program checks if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, i.e., `n = x^2` where `x` is an integer.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt = math.sqrt(n)\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [16, 20, 25, 30, 36]\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_perfect_square(num):\n            print(f\"{num} is a perfect square.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{num} is not a perfect square.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_perfect_square` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than 0, in which case it returns `False` because negative numbers cannot be perfect squares.\n3. It calculates the square root of `n` using the `math.sqrt` function.\n4. It checks if the square root is equal to its integer part (i.e., `sqrt == int(sqrt)`). If this condition is true, then `n` is a perfect square, and the function returns `True`.\n5. In the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of the `is_perfect_square` function with a list of example numbers.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\n16 is a perfect square.\n20 is not a perfect square.\n25 is a perfect square.\n30 is not a perfect square.\n36 is a perfect square.\n```",
