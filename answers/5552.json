  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\n# Test the function\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(\"The average of the numbers is: \", calculate_average(numbers))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of all numbers in the list.\n3. **For Loop**: We use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list, adding it to the `total`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: After the loop, we calculate the average by dividing the `total` by the length of the list (i.e., the number of elements).\n5. **Return**: The function returns the calculated average.\n6. **Testing**: We create a test list of numbers and call the `calculate_average` function to print the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the average grade of a student from a list of exam scores.\n* Find the average price of a set of products from an online store.\n* Determine the average temperature of a city over a period of time from a list of daily temperatures.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to handle the case where the input list is empty to avoid division by zero errors.\n* Consider using the built-in `sum` function to simplify the calculation of the total sum.\n* You can also use the `statistics` module in Python, which provides a `mean` function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.",
