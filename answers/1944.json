  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns their concatenation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef concatenate(list1, list2):\n    out = []\n    for i in range(0, len(list1)):\n        out.append(list1[i])\n    for i in range(0, len(list2)):\n        out.append(list2[i])\n    return out\n\nprint(concatenate([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\nThis code defines the `concatenate` function, which takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the two input lists. The function uses two loops to iterate over the elements of `list1` and `list2`, appending each element to the `out` list. Finally, the function returns the `out` list.\n\nThe code also includes an example usage of the `concatenate` function, where we pass two lists `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` as arguments, and print the result to the console. The output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the concatenation of the two input lists.",
