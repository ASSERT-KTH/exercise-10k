  "answer": "### Expense Tracker Function\n#### Description\nThe following function allows users to track their expenses by storing them in a list. Each expense is categorized and has an associated amount.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nclass ExpenseTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.expenses = []\n\n    def add_expense(self, category, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add an expense to the tracker.\n\n        Args:\n            category (str): Category of the expense (e.g., 'food', 'transportation', etc.)\n            amount (float): Amount of the expense\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        self.expenses.append({\"category\": category, \"amount\": amount})\n\n    def get_expenses(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get all expenses in the tracker.\n\n        Returns:\n            list: List of dictionaries, each containing the category and amount of an expense\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.expenses\n\n    def get_expenses_by_category(self, category):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get all expenses in a specific category.\n\n        Args:\n            category (str): Category of the expenses to retrieve\n\n        Returns:\n            list: List of dictionaries, each containing the category and amount of an expense in the specified category\n        \"\"\"\n        return [expense for expense in self.expenses if expense[\"category\"] == category]\n\n    def calculate_total_expenses(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the total amount of all expenses.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Total amount of all expenses\n        \"\"\"\n        return sum(expense[\"amount\"] for expense in self.expenses)\n\n    def calculate_total_expenses_by_category(self, category):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the total amount of expenses in a specific category.\n\n        Args:\n            category (str): Category of the expenses to calculate\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Total amount of expenses in the specified category\n        \"\"\"\n        return sum(expense[\"amount\"] for expense in self.expenses if expense[\"category\"] == category)\n\n\ndef main():\n    tracker = ExpenseTracker()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nExpense Tracker Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Expense\")\n        print(\"2. Get All Expenses\")\n        print(\"3. Get Expenses by Category\")\n        print(\"4. Calculate Total Expenses\")\n        print(\"5. Calculate Total Expenses by Category\")\n        print(\"6. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            category = input(\"Enter category: \")\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount: \"))\n            tracker.add_expense(category, amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            print(tracker.get_expenses())\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            category = input(\"Enter category: \")\n            print(tracker.get_expenses_by_category(category))\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(tracker.calculate_total_expenses())\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            category = input(\"Enter category: \")\n            print(tracker.calculate_total_expenses_by_category(category))\n        elif choice == \"6\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Example Usage\nTo use the expense tracker, create an instance of the `ExpenseTracker` class and call the `add_expense` method to add expenses. You can then use the `get_expenses`, `get_expenses_by_category`, `calculate_total_expenses`, and `calculate_total_expenses_by_category` methods to retrieve and calculate expenses.\n\nThe `main` function provides a simple menu-driven interface to demonstrate the usage of the `ExpenseTracker` class.",
