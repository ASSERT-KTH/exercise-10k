  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers using a loop. The program should ask the user for the value of n and then calculate the sum.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\n# Importing Libraries\nimport math\n\n# Function Definition\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        sum += i**2\n    return sum\n\n# Main Program\nn = int(input(\"Enter the value of n: \"))\nresult = sum_of_squares(n)\nprint(\"The sum of the squares of the first\", n, \"natural numbers is:\", result)\n```\nNote that I've left the author and date fields blank for you to fill in. Also, I've used the `int(input(...))` syntax to get the user input and convert it to an integer, as specified in the requirements.",
