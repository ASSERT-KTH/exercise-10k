Here's a breakdown of the methods and their functionality:\n\n*   `__init__`: Initializes an empty queue as a list.\n*   `enqueue`: Adds an item to the end of the queue using the `append` method.\n*   `dequeue`: Removes and returns the item at the front of the queue using the `pop(0)` method. If the queue is empty, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   `peek`: Returns the item at the front of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   `is_empty`: Checks if the queue is empty by comparing its length to 0.\n*   `size`: Returns the number of items in the queue using the `len` function.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to create a queue, enqueue items, peek at the front item, dequeue items, and check if the queue is empty.\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis\n\nThe time complexity of the queue operations is as follows:\n\n*   `enqueue`: O(1) because appending to a list in Python is a constant-time operation.\n*   `dequeue`: O(n) because removing the first item from a list in Python requires shifting all other elements, which takes linear time.\n*   `peek`: O(1) because accessing the first element of a list in Python is a constant-time operation.\n*   `is_empty`: O(1) because checking the length of a list in Python is a constant-time operation.\n*   `size`: O(1) because retrieving the length of a list in Python is a constant-time operation.\n\nNote that the `dequeue` operation has a linear time complexity due to the underlying list implementation. For a more efficient queue implementation, consider using a linked list or a collections.deque in Python, which provides O(1) time complexity for both `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.",
