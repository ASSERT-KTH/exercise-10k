  "answer": "**Alarm Clock Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that acts as an alarm clock using a while loop to wait for the alarm time.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nimport time\nimport winsound\n\ndef set_alarm(alarm_time, sound_duration=1000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Set an alarm for a specific time.\n\n    Args:\n        alarm_time (str): The time to set the alarm for in 'HH:MM' format.\n        sound_duration (int): The duration of the alarm sound in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Alarm set for {alarm_time}\")\n\n    while True:\n        current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%H:%M\")\n        if current_time == alarm_time:\n            print(\"Wake Up!\")\n            winsound.Beep(2500, sound_duration)  # 2500 Hz frequency, 1000 ms duration\n            break\n        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before checking the time again\n\ndef main():\n    alarm_time = input(\"Enter the alarm time in 'HH:MM' format: \")\n    set_alarm(alarm_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How to Use**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the alarm time in 'HH:MM' format when prompted.\n3. The program will wait for the specified time and play a beep sound when the alarm time is reached.\n\n**Note**\n--------\n\n* This program uses the `winsound` module, which is specific to Windows. If you're on a different platform, you'll need to use a different method to play the alarm sound.\n* The `time.sleep(1)` call is used to pause the program for 1 second between each time check. This helps to avoid using too much CPU time.\n* The alarm sound is played using the `winsound.Beep` function, which takes two arguments: the frequency of the sound (in Hz) and the duration of the sound (in milliseconds).",
