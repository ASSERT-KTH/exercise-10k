  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that implements the specified algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef smallest_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"Find the smallest divisor of a number.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n\ndef sum_of_prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"Find the sum of all prime factors of a number.\"\"\"\n    sum_of_factors = 0\n    while n > 1:\n        divisor = smallest_divisor(n)\n        if is_prime(divisor):\n            sum_of_factors += divisor\n        n = n // divisor\n    return sum_of_factors\n\n# Test the function\nn = 315\nprint(\"Sum of prime factors of\", n, \"is\", sum_of_prime_factors(n))\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n*   The `is_prime(n)` function checks if a number `n` is prime. It iterates from 2 to `n-1` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, the function returns `False`. If it's not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `True`.\n*   The `smallest_divisor(n)` function finds the smallest divisor of a number `n`. It iterates from 2 to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. As soon as it finds a divisor, it returns that number.\n*   The `sum_of_prime_factors(n)` function finds the sum of all prime factors of a number `n`. It uses a while loop to continuously divide `n` by the smallest divisor until `n` is no longer divisible. If the divisor is prime, it adds the divisor to the sum of factors.\n*   Finally, the code tests the `sum_of_prime_factors(n)` function with the number 315 and prints the result.\n\nThis solution follows the specified algorithm and uses a while loop to divide the input number by the smallest divisor until it is no longer divisible. It also uses a for loop to check for primality. However, the algorithm used in the `is_prime(n)` function is not the most efficient way to check for primality, especially for large numbers. A more efficient approach would be to iterate up to the square root of `n` instead of `n-1`.",
