  "answer": "**Calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**\n=====================================================\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Method: Euclidean Algorithm**\n-----------------------------\n\nWe will use the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD. This algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n---------------------\n\nHere is a Python function that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n--------------\n\n1. The function `calculate_gcd` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The while loop continues until `b` becomes 0.\n3. In each iteration, `a` is replaced by `b`, and `b` is replaced by the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n4. When `b` becomes 0, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n5. The `abs` function is used to ensure the GCD is always positive, even if the input numbers are negative.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n--------------------\n\nIn the example usage, we calculate the GCD of 48 and 18. The output will be `6`, which is the largest positive integer that divides both 48 and 18 without leaving a remainder.",
