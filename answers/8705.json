  "answer": "**Number Sequence Printer**\n\nBelow is an example of how you can achieve this using Python:\n\n```python\ndef print_number_sequence():\n    # Get the starting and ending numbers from the user\n    start_num = int(input(\"Enter the starting number: \"))\n    end_num = int(input(\"Enter the ending number: \"))\n\n    # Validate the input to ensure start_num is less than or equal to end_num\n    while start_num > end_num:\n        print(\"The starting number should be less than or equal to the ending number.\")\n        start_num = int(input(\"Enter the starting number: \"))\n        end_num = int(input(\"Enter the ending number: \"))\n\n    # Print the numbers in sequence\n    for num in range(start_num, end_num + 1):\n        print(num)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_number_sequence()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The program first prompts the user to input the starting and ending numbers.\n2. It then checks if the starting number is greater than the ending number. If so, it asks the user to input the numbers again.\n3. Once the input is valid, it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from the starting number to the ending number (inclusive) using the `range()` function.\n4. Finally, it prints out each number in the sequence.\n\nYou can save this code to a file (e.g., `number_sequence.py`) and run it from the command line using `python number_sequence.py`.",
