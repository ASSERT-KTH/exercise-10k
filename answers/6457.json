  "answer": "**Sphere Surface Area Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is `4 * \u03c0 * r^2`, where `r` is the radius of the sphere.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_surface_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the surface area of a sphere given its radius.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The surface area of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n    return surface_area\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the sphere: \"))\n    try:\n        surface_area = calculate_surface_area(radius)\n        print(f\"The surface area of the sphere is: {surface_area:.2f}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_surface_area` function takes the radius as input and returns the surface area.\n2. The function checks if the radius is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n3. The surface area is calculated using the formula `4 * \u03c0 * r^2`.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_surface_area` function.\n5. The user is prompted to enter the radius, and the surface area is calculated and printed.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 5 units:\n\t+ Input: `5`\n\t+ Output: `The surface area of the sphere is: 314.16`\n* Calculate the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 10 units:\n\t+ Input: `10`\n\t+ Output: `The surface area of the sphere is: 1256.64`",
