  "answer": "### Person Class with Age-Based Status\n#### Overview\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of a `Person` class with attributes for `name`, `age`, and `occupation`. A function `calculate_status` is added to determine the person's status based on their age.\n\n#### Code\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, occupation: str):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Person object.\n\n        Args:\n        - name (str): The person's name.\n        - age (int): The person's age.\n        - occupation (str): The person's occupation.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.occupation = occupation\n\n    def calculate_status(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the person's status based on their age.\n\n        Returns:\n        - str: The person's status (e.g., \"Child\", \"Teenager\", \"Adult\", \"Senior\").\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.age < 13:\n            return \"Child\"\n        elif self.age < 20:\n            return \"Teenager\"\n        elif self.age < 65:\n            return \"Adult\"\n        else:\n            return \"Senior\"\n\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    person1 = Person(\"John Doe\", 25, \"Software Engineer\")\n    person2 = Person(\"Jane Doe\", 70, \"Retiree\")\n\n    print(f\"{person1.name}'s status: {person1.calculate_status()}\")\n    print(f\"{person2.name}'s status: {person2.calculate_status()}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `Person` class has an initializer (`__init__`) that sets the `name`, `age`, and `occupation` attributes.\n*   The `calculate_status` method determines the person's status based on their age and returns it as a string.\n*   In the `main` function, two `Person` objects are created with different ages, and their statuses are printed to demonstrate the usage of the `calculate_status` method.",
