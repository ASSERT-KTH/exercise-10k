  "prompt": "Write a program that prints multiples of 3 from 1 to 30 using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that prints multiples of 3 from 1 to 30 using a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Define the range\nstart = 1\nend = 30\n\n# Iterate over the range\nfor i in range(start, end + 1):\n    # Check if the number is a multiple of 3\n    if i % 3 == 0:\n        # Print the multiple of 3\n        print(i)\n```\n\nThis program defines a range from 1 to 30 and then iterates over this range using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is a multiple of 3 by using the modulus operator `%`. If `i` is a multiple of 3, it prints `i`.\n\nYou can also use a more Pythonic way to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Iterate over the range\nfor i in range(3, 31, 3):\n    # Print the multiple of 3\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis version of the program uses the `range` function with a step size of 3, which means it generates numbers from 3 to 30, incrementing by 3 each time. This way, you don't need to check if a number is a multiple of 3 inside the loop, because the `range` function only generates multiples of 3.",
