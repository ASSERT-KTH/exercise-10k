  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two decimal numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two decimal numbers as input and returns their sum.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first decimal number.\n        num2 (float): The second decimal number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first decimal number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second decimal number: \"))\n\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, which are the two decimal numbers we want to add.\n*   Inside the function, we simply return the sum of `num1` and `num2` using the `+` operator.\n*   In the example usage section, we use the `input` function to get two decimal numbers from the user and convert them to `float` using the `float` function.\n*   We then call the `add_numbers` function with the two input numbers and print the result.\n\n### Running the Program\n\nTo run this program, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `add_numbers.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python add_numbers.py`). When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two decimal numbers, and then it will print their sum.",
