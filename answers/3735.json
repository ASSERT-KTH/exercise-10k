  "answer": "Here is a Python program that reads a string from the user and prints it out with a suffix added to each line:\n\n```python\ndef print_with_suffix(input_string, suffix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the input string with a suffix added to each line.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The string to print.\n        suffix (str): The suffix to add to each line.\n    \"\"\"\n    lines = input_string.split('\\n')\n    for line in lines:\n        print(line + suffix)\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Please enter a string: \")\n    suffix = input(\"Please enter a suffix: \")\n    print_with_suffix(input_string, suffix)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n1. **Get user input**: The program first prompts the user to enter a string and a suffix.\n2. **Split into lines**: The input string is split into lines using the newline character (`\\n`) as the delimiter.\n3. **Add suffix and print**: Each line is then printed with the suffix added to the end.\n4. **Main function**: The `main` function handles the user input and calls the `print_with_suffix` function with the provided string and suffix.\n\n### Example usage\n```\nPlease enter a string: Hello\nWorld\nThis is a test\nPlease enter a suffix: !\nHello!\nWorld!\nThis is a test!\n```",
