  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 using a for loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_even_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 101):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even_sum += i\n    return even_sum\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to execute the program.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = calculate_even_sum()\n    print(\"The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is:\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_even_sum` function initializes a variable `even_sum` to store the sum of even numbers.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`).\n4. If the number is even, it adds the number to the `even_sum`.\n5. The function returns the final `even_sum`.\n6. The `main` function calls `calculate_even_sum` and prints the result.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2550\n```\n\n### Running the Program\n\nSave this code in a file (e.g., `even_sum.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python even_sum.py`). The program will output the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.",
