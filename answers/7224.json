  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers. The program should take an array as input and return the maximum value. If the array is empty, the program should return a message indicating that the array is empty.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications you provided:\n```\ndef findMax(array):\n    if not array:\n        return \"Array is empty\"\n    return max(array)\n\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(findMax(array))  # Output: 5\n```\nI've written the code in Python, as it's a simple and concise language that matches the specifications. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the code!",
