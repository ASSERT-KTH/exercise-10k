  "answer": "### Calculating the Median of a List of Numbers\n#### Function Description\n\nThe `calculate_median` function calculates the median of a given list of numbers. If the list is empty, it raises a `ValueError`. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The median of the list of numbers.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate median of an empty list\")\n\n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        return numbers[n // 2]\n    # If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements\n    else:\n        return (numbers[n // 2 - 1] + numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n    print(calculate_median(numbers))  # Output: 5\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    print(calculate_median(numbers))  # Output: 3.5\n\n    try:\n        print(calculate_median([]))\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)  # Output: Cannot calculate median of an empty list\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised.\n2. The list is then sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method.\n3. The length of the list is obtained using the `len` function.\n4. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is returned directly.\n5. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements, which is calculated and returned.\n6. In the example usage, the function is called with different lists of numbers, including an empty list to demonstrate the error handling.",
