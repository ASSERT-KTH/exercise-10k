  "prompt": "Write a program that determines whether a given number is even or odd using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks whether a number is even or odd using conditional statements:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_odd(num):\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{num} is an even number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is an odd number.\")\n\n# Test the function\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\ncheck_even_odd(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `check_even_odd` function takes an integer `num` as input and uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder when `num` is divided by 2.\n*   If the remainder is 0 (`num % 2 == 0`), it means the number is even, so the program prints a message stating that the number is even.\n*   If the remainder is not 0 (`num % 2 != 0`), it means the number is odd, so the program prints a message stating that the number is odd.\n*   The program then asks the user to enter a number using the `input` function and passes this number to the `check_even_odd` function to determine whether it's even or odd.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   When you enter `10`, the program outputs: `10 is an even number.`\n*   When you enter `11`, the program outputs: `11 is an odd number.`",
