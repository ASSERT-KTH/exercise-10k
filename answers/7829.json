  "prompt": "Create a program that simulates a phonebook using a dictionary. The program should allow users to add, remove, and search for contacts. When adding a contact, the program should prompt for the name and phone number. When removing a contact, the program should prompt for the name of the contact to remove. When searching for a contact, the program should prompt for the name and display the corresponding phone number if found.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that simulates a phonebook using a dictionary:\n```python\nclass Phonebook:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.contacts = {}\n\n    def add_contact(self):\n        \"\"\"Add a new contact to the phonebook\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter the name of the contact: \")\n        phone_number = input(\"Enter the phone number of the contact: \")\n        self.contacts[name] = phone_number\n        print(f\"Contact '{name}' added successfully!\")\n\n    def remove_contact(self):\n        \"\"\"Remove a contact from the phonebook\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter the name of the contact to remove: \")\n        if name in self.contacts:\n            del self.contacts[name]\n            print(f\"Contact '{name}' removed successfully!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Contact '{name}' not found!\")\n\n    def search_contact(self):\n        \"\"\"Search for a contact in the phonebook\"\"\"\n        name = input(\"Enter the name of the contact to search: \")\n        if name in self.contacts:\n            print(f\"Phone number of '{name}': {self.contacts[name]}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Contact '{name}' not found!\")\n\n    def display_contacts(self):\n        \"\"\"Display all contacts in the phonebook\"\"\"\n        if not self.contacts:\n            print(\"No contacts in the phonebook!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Contacts:\")\n            for name, phone_number in self.contacts.items():\n                print(f\"{name}: {phone_number}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    phonebook = Phonebook()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nPhonebook Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Add Contact\")\n        print(\"2. Remove Contact\")\n        print(\"3. Search Contact\")\n        print(\"4. Display Contacts\")\n        print(\"5. Quit\")\n        choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            phonebook.add_contact()\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            phonebook.remove_contact()\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            phonebook.search_contact()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            phonebook.display_contacts()\n        elif choice == \"5\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the program works:\n\n1. The `Phonebook` class is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes an empty dictionary `contacts` to store the phonebook data.\n2. The `add_contact`, `remove_contact`, and `search_contact` methods prompt the user for input and perform the corresponding actions on the `contacts` dictionary.\n3. The `display_contacts` method displays all contacts in the phonebook.\n4. The `main` function creates an instance of the `Phonebook` class and enters a loop that displays a menu to the user.\n5. The user can choose to add, remove, search, or display contacts, or quit the program.\n6. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding method is called on the `Phonebook` instance.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Add a contact: Choose option 1, enter the name and phone number, and the contact will be added to the phonebook.\n* Remove a contact: Choose option 2, enter the name of the contact to remove, and the contact will be removed from the phonebook if found.\n* Search for a contact: Choose option 3, enter the name of the contact to search, and the corresponding phone number will be displayed if found.\n* Display contacts: Choose option 4, and all contacts in the phonebook will be displayed.\n* Quit: Choose option 5, and the program will exit.",
