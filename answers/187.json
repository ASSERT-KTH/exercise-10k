  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a while loop to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python using a while loop:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef game():\n    while True:\n        # Get the user's choice\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): \").lower()\n\n        # Validate the user's choice\n        while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n            user_choice = input(\"Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n\n        # Get the computer's choice\n        choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n\n        # Print out the choices\n        print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n\n        # Determine the winner\n        if user_choice == computer_choice:\n            print(f\"Both players selected {user_choice}. It's a tie!\")\n        elif user_choice == \"rock\":\n            if computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"paper\":\n            if computer_choice == \"rock\":\n                print(\"Paper covers rock! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You lose.\")\n        elif user_choice == \"scissors\":\n            if computer_choice == \"paper\":\n                print(\"Scissors cuts paper! You win!\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Rock smashes scissors! You lose.\")\n\n        # Ask the user if they want to play again\n        play_again = input(\"Play again? (yes/no): \").lower()\n        while play_again not in [\"yes\", \"no\"]:\n            play_again = input(\"Invalid input. Please enter yes or no: \").lower()\n\n        if play_again != \"yes\":\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n1. **User Input**: The program starts by asking the user to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.\n2. **Validation**: The input is validated to ensure it is one of the allowed choices. If the input is invalid, the user is asked to enter their choice again.\n3. **Computer Choice**: The computer's choice is randomly selected from the list of allowed choices.\n4. **Determine Winner**: The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules:\n   * Rock beats scissors\n   * Scissors beats paper\n   * Paper beats rock\n   * If both players choose the same option, it's a tie\n5. **Play Again**: After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. If they choose to play again, the game continues. If they choose not to play again, the game ends.",
