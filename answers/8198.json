  "answer": "**Binary Search Implementation**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(arr, target)\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the middle index `mid` using the average of `left` and `right`.\n3.  Compare the middle element `arr[mid]` with the target element.\n    *   If they are equal, return the middle index.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until `left` is greater than `right`.\n5.  If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This makes it much faster than linear search for large datasets.",
