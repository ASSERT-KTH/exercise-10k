  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n==========================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest on an investment.\n\n    Args:\n        principal (float): Initial investment amount\n        rate (float): Annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g. 5% = 0.05)\n        time (int): Time period in years\n        frequency (int): Compounding frequency (e.g. 1 for annually, 12 for monthly)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Total amount after compound interest\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * (1 + rate / frequency) ** (frequency * time)\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in %): \")) / 100\n    time = int(input(\"Enter the time period in years: \"))\n    frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency (e.g. 1 for annually, 12 for monthly): \"))\n\n    # Calculate compound interest\n    total_amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, frequency)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"The total amount after {time} years is: ${total_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The compound interest earned is: ${total_amount - principal:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program and enter the principal amount: `1000`\n2. Enter the annual interest rate: `5`\n3. Enter the time period in years: `5`\n4. Enter the compounding frequency: `12` (monthly)\n5. The program will calculate and print the total amount after 5 years and the compound interest earned.\n\n### Note\n\n* This program assumes that the interest rate is constant over the time period.\n* The compounding frequency should be a positive integer (e.g. 1 for annually, 12 for monthly).\n* The program uses the formula for compound interest: `A = P * (1 + r/n) ^ (nt)`, where `A` is the total amount, `P` is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, `n` is the compounding frequency, and `t` is the time period.",
