  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program that takes two integers as input and returns their sum:\n```\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The sum of the two integers is:\", result)\n```\nThis program defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their sum. The `input` function is used to get the two integers from the user, and the `int` function is used to convert the input strings to integers. Finally, the `print` function is used to print the result.\n\nYou can also write this program in a more concise way:\n```\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\nprint(\"The sum of the two integers is:\", num1 + num2)\n```\nThis program does the same thing as the previous one, but without defining a separate function.",
