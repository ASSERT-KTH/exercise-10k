  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that does that:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_of_numbers}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Run this Program\n\n1. Save this code in a file called `add_numbers.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python add_numbers.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.\n5. The program will print the sum of the two numbers.\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `add_numbers` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n*   The `main` function gets two numbers from the user, calculates their sum using the `add_numbers` function, and prints the result.\n*   The program uses `float` to allow the user to enter decimal numbers.\n*   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` line ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module in another script.",
