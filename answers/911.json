  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that filters a list of variables based on their data types:\n\n```python\ndef filter_by_type(data, data_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of variables based on their data types.\n\n    Args:\n        data (list): A list of variables to be filtered.\n        data_type (type): The data type to filter by.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of variables of the specified data type.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [x for x in data if isinstance(x, data_type)]\n\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [1, 2.5, 'hello', 3, 4.7, 'world', 5, 6.9]\n\n# Filter integers\nintegers = filter_by_type(data, int)\nprint(\"Integers:\", integers)\n\n# Filter floats\nfloats = filter_by_type(data, float)\nprint(\"Floats:\", floats)\n\n# Filter strings\nstrings = filter_by_type(data, str)\nprint(\"Strings:\", strings)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `filter_by_type` that takes a list of variables `data` and a data type `data_type` as arguments.\n2.  Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the `data` list and include only the elements that are instances of the specified `data_type`. We use the `isinstance` function to check the type of each element.\n3.  The function returns the filtered list of variables.\n4.  In the example usage, we create a sample list `data` containing variables of different data types (integers, floats, and strings).\n5.  We then call the `filter_by_type` function to filter the list for integers, floats, and strings, and print the results.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nIntegers: [1, 3, 5]\nFloats: [2.5, 4.7, 6.9]\nStrings: ['hello', 'world']\n```",
