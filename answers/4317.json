  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a function that checks the type of a variable and returns an error message if it's not the expected type, and then provide a clear explanation of how the function works. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_type(var, expected_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the type of a variable and returns an error message if it's not the expected type.\n\n    Args:\n        var (any): The variable to be checked.\n        expected_type (type): The expected type of the variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        str or None: An error message if the variable is not of the expected type, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the type of the variable is the same as the expected type\n    # We can use the isinstance() function in Python to check if an object is an instance of a class or its subclass\n    if not isinstance(var, expected_type):\n        \n        # If the variable is not of the expected type, we return an error message\n        # The error message should include the actual type of the variable and the expected type\n        # We can use the type() function to get the type of the variable\n        return f\"Error: Expected {expected_type.__name__} but got {type(var).__name__}\"\n    \n    # If the variable is of the expected type, we return None\n    # This indicates that there is no error\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(check_type(5, int))  # Should return None\nprint(check_type(\"hello\", int))  # Should return an error message\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `check_type` takes two parameters: `var` (the variable to be checked) and `expected_type` (the expected type of the variable). It uses the `isinstance()` function to check if the variable is of the expected type.\n* If the variable is not of the expected type, the function returns an error message that includes the actual type of the variable and the expected type. This is achieved by using the `type()` function to get the type of the variable and `expected_type.__name__` to get the name of the expected type.\n* The function returns `None` if the variable is of the expected type, indicating that there is no error.\n* Example usage is provided to demonstrate how to use the `check_type` function with different inputs, such as an integer and a string, and how it returns an error message or `None` accordingly.",
