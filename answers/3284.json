  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop in Python:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        result *= i\n        i += 1\n    return result\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif num < 0:\n    print(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\nelif num == 0 or num == 1:\n    print(\"Factorial of\", num, \"is 1.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The function `factorial(n)` is defined to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`.\n2. Inside the function, `result` is initialized to 1 and `i` is initialized to 1.\n3. A while loop is used to iterate from `i = 1` to `n`. In each iteration, `result` is multiplied by `i` and then `i` is incremented by 1.\n4. After the loop finishes, the function returns the calculated factorial.\n5. The user is asked to input a number.\n6. The program checks if the input number is negative, in which case it prints an error message because factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n7. If the input number is 0 or 1, it prints the factorial as 1, because the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined to be 1.\n8. For any other positive number, it calls the `factorial(n)` function and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n- Input: `5`\n  Output: `Factorial of 5 is 120`\n- Input: `0`\n  Output: `Factorial of 0 is 1`\n- Input: `-3`\n  Output: `Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.`",
