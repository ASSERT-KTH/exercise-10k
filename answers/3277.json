  "answer": "**Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers using a For Loop**\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program calculates the average of a list of numbers by iterating over the list using a for loop and summing up all the numbers. The average is then calculated by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    return average\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    average = calculate_average(numbers)\n    print(f\"The average of {numbers} is {average}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of all the numbers.\n3. It uses a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, adding each number to the `total`.\n4. After the loop, it calculates the average by dividing the `total` by the length of the list.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_average` function with an example list of numbers.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0\n```\n\nNote: This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError. You may want to add error handling to handle such cases.",
