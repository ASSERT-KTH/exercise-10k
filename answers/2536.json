  "answer": "**Minimum Number of Coins Needed to Make Change**\n\nThis program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using dynamic programming.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(coins, amount):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.\n\n    Args:\n        coins (list): List of coin denominations.\n        amount (int): The amount to make change for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of coins needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the given amount\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # We need 0 coins to make change for 0 amount\n\n    # Iterate over each coin denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # Iterate over each amount from the coin denomination to the given amount\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            # Update the minimum number of coins needed for the current amount\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # If we cannot make change for the given amount, return -1\n    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return dp[amount]\n\n# Example usage\ncoins = [1, 2, 5]\namount = 11\nprint(\"Minimum number of coins needed:\", min_coins(coins, amount))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**: We create a DP table `dp` of size `amount + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for amount `i`. We initialize all values to infinity except `dp[0]`, which is set to 0 since we need 0 coins to make change for 0 amount.\n2.  **Coin Denominations**: We iterate over each coin denomination and update the DP table accordingly.\n3.  **Update DP Table**: For each coin denomination, we iterate over the amounts from the coin denomination to the given amount. For each amount `i`, we update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1`. This represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for amount `i`, considering the current coin denomination.\n4.  **Final Result**: After filling the DP table, we return `dp[amount]`, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given amount. If we cannot make change for the given amount (i.e., `dp[amount]` remains infinity), we return -1.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(amount \\* len(coins)), where amount is the given amount and len(coins) is the number of coin denominations.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(amount), as we need to store the DP table of size amount + 1.",
