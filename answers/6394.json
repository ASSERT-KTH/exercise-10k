  "answer": "**Rock, Paper, Scissors Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes in the user's choice and the computer's choice, then determines the winner using if/else statements.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns the computer's random choice.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Returns the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a tie!\"\n    elif (user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\") or \\\n         (user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\"):\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    while user_choice not in [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n        user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): \").lower()\n    \n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose: {user_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\\n\")\n    \n    print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.\n3. The program will display the computer's choice and determine the winner.\n4. The winner will be announced.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `get_computer_choice` function returns a random choice from the list [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"].\n2. The `determine_winner` function compares the user's and computer's choices using if/else statements to determine the winner.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user for their choice, gets the computer's choice, and displays the winner.",
