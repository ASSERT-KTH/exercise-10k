  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the wholesale price and markup percentage of a product as input and outputs its retail price.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the retail price of a product based on the wholesale price and markup percentage.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate retail price\ndef calculate_retail_price(wholesale_price, markup_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the retail price of a product based on the wholesale price and markup percentage.\n\n    Args:\n        wholesale_price (float): The wholesale price of the product.\n        markup_percentage (float): The markup percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The retail price of the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the markup amount\n    markup_amount = (wholesale_price / 100) * markup_percentage\n    \n    # Calculate the retail price\n    retail_price = wholesale_price + markup_amount\n    \n    return retail_price\n\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Get the wholesale price and markup percentage from the user\n    wholesale_price = float(input(\"Enter the wholesale price: \"))\n    markup_percentage = float(input(\"Enter the markup percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the retail price\n    retail_price = calculate_retail_price(wholesale_price, markup_percentage)\n\n    # Print the retail price\n    print(f\"The retail price is: ${retail_price:.2f}\")\n\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `calculate_retail_price` function calculates the retail price of a product based on the wholesale price and markup percentage.\n2.  It takes two arguments, `wholesale_price` and `markup_percentage`, both of which are floats.\n3.  The function calculates the markup amount by multiplying the wholesale price by the markup percentage divided by 100.\n4.  Then, it calculates the retail price by adding the markup amount to the wholesale price.\n5.  The `main` function gets the wholesale price and markup percentage from the user, calls the `calculate_retail_price` function, and prints the retail price.\n6.  The retail price is formatted to two decimal places using the `{:.2f}` format specifier.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and enter the wholesale price and markup percentage when prompted. For example:\n\n```\nEnter the wholesale price: 100\nEnter the markup percentage: 20\nThe retail price is: $120.00\n```",
