  "prompt": "Create a program that takes the total bill and tip percentage as input, and returns the tip amount and total bill with tip.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python solution that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_tip(total_bill, tip_percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the tip amount and total bill with tip.\n\n    Args:\n    - total_bill (float): The total bill amount.\n    - tip_percentage (float): The tip percentage.\n\n    Returns:\n    - tip_amount (float): The calculated tip amount.\n    - total_bill_with_tip (float): The total bill with tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the tip amount\n    tip_amount = (tip_percentage / 100) * total_bill\n    \n    # Calculate the total bill with tip\n    total_bill_with_tip = total_bill + tip_amount\n    \n    return tip_amount, total_bill_with_tip\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    total_bill = 100.0\n    tip_percentage = 15.0\n    \n    tip_amount, total_bill_with_tip = calculate_tip(total_bill, tip_percentage)\n    \n    print(f\"Total Bill: ${total_bill:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Tip Percentage: {tip_percentage}%\")\n    print(f\"Tip Amount: ${tip_amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Bill with Tip: ${total_bill_with_tip:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_tip` that takes two arguments: `total_bill` and `tip_percentage`.\n2.  Calculate the tip amount by multiplying the total bill with the tip percentage divided by 100.\n3.  Calculate the total bill with tip by adding the total bill and the tip amount.\n4.  Return the tip amount and the total bill with tip.\n5.  In the `main` function, demonstrate the usage of `calculate_tip` with example values and print the results.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nTotal Bill: $100.00\nTip Percentage: 15.0%\nTip Amount: $15.00\nTotal Bill with Tip: $115.00\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n*   You can modify the `main` function to accept user input for `total_bill` and `tip_percentage` to make the program more interactive.\n*   Consider adding input validation to ensure that `total_bill` and `tip_percentage` are non-negative numbers.",
