  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. The program should ask for the person's age and then print out whether they are eligible to vote or not. In this country, a person is eligible to vote if they are 18 years old or more.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_voting_eligibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks for a person's age and checks if they are eligible to vote.\n    \"\"\"\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n\n    if age >= 18:\n        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_voting_eligibility()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The program defines a function `check_voting_eligibility` that contains the main logic.\n2. Inside the function, it uses the built-in `input` function to ask the user for their age and converts the input to an integer using `int()`.\n3. It then checks if the age is 18 or more using an `if` statement. If the condition is true, it prints out that the person is eligible to vote. Otherwise, it prints out that they are not eligible.\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to ensure that the `check_voting_eligibility` function is called when the script is run directly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nWhen you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your age. For example:\n\n```\nPlease enter your age: 25\nYou are eligible to vote.\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nPlease enter your age: 17\nYou are not eligible to vote.\n```",
