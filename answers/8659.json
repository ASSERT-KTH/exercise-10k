  "answer": "**Finding Common Elements in a List of Lists**\n=====================================================\n\nHere's a Python function that finds the common elements in a list of lists. This function uses the built-in `set` data structure to efficiently find the intersection of all sets.\n\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the common elements in a list of lists.\n\n    Args:\n        lists (list): A list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of common elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not lists:\n        return []\n\n    # Initialize the set of common elements with the first list\n    common_elements = set(lists[0])\n\n    # Iterate over the remaining lists\n    for lst in lists[1:]:\n        # Update the set of common elements by intersecting it with the current list\n        common_elements &= set(lst)\n\n    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list and return it\n    return list(common_elements)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    lists = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5]]\n    common = find_common_elements(lists)\n    print(\"Common elements:\", common)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  We start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.\n2.  We initialize the set of common elements with the first list.\n3.  We iterate over the remaining lists, updating the set of common elements by intersecting it with the current list using the `&=` operator.\n4.  Finally, we convert the set of common elements back to a list and return it.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m), where n is the number of lists and m is the maximum length of a list. This is because we iterate over each list once, and for each list, we iterate over its elements to create a set.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\nThe space complexity of this function is O(m), where m is the maximum length of a list. This is because we store the set of common elements, which can contain up to m elements.",
