  "answer": "Swapping the Values of Two Variables\n=====================================\n\nSwapping the values of two variables without using a temporary variable can be achieved through various methods. Here are a few approaches:\n\n### 1. Arithmetic Method\n\nThis method involves using arithmetic operations to swap the values of two variables.\n\n```python\ndef swap_arithmetic(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables using arithmetic operations.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    a = a + b  # Store the sum of a and b in a\n    b = a - b  # Store the original value of a in b\n    a = a - b  # Store the original value of b in a\n    print(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage:\na = 5\nb = 10\nswap_arithmetic(a, b)\n```\n\n### 2. Bitwise XOR Method\n\nThis method involves using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to swap the values of two variables.\n\n```python\ndef swap_xor(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables using bitwise XOR.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    a = a ^ b  # Store the XOR of a and b in a\n    b = a ^ b  # Store the original value of a in b\n    a = a ^ b  # Store the original value of b in a\n    print(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage:\na = 5\nb = 10\nswap_xor(a, b)\n```\n\n### 3. Tuple Packing and Unpacking Method\n\nThis method involves using tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values of two variables.\n\n```python\ndef swap_tuple(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap the values of two variables using tuple packing and unpacking.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first variable.\n        b (int): The second variable.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The swapped values.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    a, b = b, a  # Swap the values using tuple packing and unpacking\n    print(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n    return a, b\n\n# Example usage:\na = 5\nb = 10\nswap_tuple(a, b)\n```\n\nComparison of Methods\n--------------------\n\n| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arithmetic | Simple and easy to understand | May cause overflow for large numbers |\n| Bitwise XOR | Fast and efficient | May be less intuitive for some developers |\n| Tuple Packing and Unpacking | Pythonic and easy to read | Limited to Python and other languages that support tuple packing and unpacking |\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSwapping the values of two variables without using a temporary variable can be achieved through various methods, including arithmetic, bitwise XOR, and tuple packing and unpacking. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific use case and personal preference.",
