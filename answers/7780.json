  "prompt": "Write a program to analyze data stored in a dictionary. The dictionary contains student information with keys as student names and values as another dictionary containing their grades for different subjects. Calculate the average grade for each student and print the student's name along with their average grade. If a student has all grades above 90, mark them as 'Outstanding', otherwise, mark them as 'Needs Improvement'.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_student_data(student_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyze student data stored in a dictionary and calculate the average grade for each student.\n    \n    Args:\n        student_data (dict): A dictionary containing student information with keys as student names and values as another dictionary containing their grades for different subjects.\n    \n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    for student, grades in student_data.items():\n        # Calculate the average grade\n        average_grade = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)\n        \n        # Check if the student has all grades above 90\n        if all(grade > 90 for grade in grades.values()):\n            performance = 'Outstanding'\n        else:\n            performance = 'Needs Improvement'\n        \n        # Print the student's name, average grade, and performance\n        print(f\"Student: {student}, Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}, Performance: {performance}\")\n\n\n# Example usage:\nstudent_data = {\n    'John': {'Math': 95, 'Science': 92, 'English': 98},\n    'Alice': {'Math': 80, 'Science': 85, 'English': 90},\n    'Bob': {'Math': 98, 'Science': 95, 'English': 99}\n}\n\nanalyze_student_data(student_data)\n```\n\nIn this program, the `analyze_student_data` function iterates over each student in the `student_data` dictionary. For each student, it calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades. It then checks if all grades are above 90 and marks the student as 'Outstanding' or 'Needs Improvement' accordingly. Finally, it prints the student's name, average grade, and performance.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `analyze_student_data` function with a sample `student_data` dictionary. The output will be:\n\n```\nStudent: John, Average Grade: 95.00, Performance: Outstanding\nStudent: Alice, Average Grade: 85.00, Performance: Needs Improvement\nStudent: Bob, Average Grade: 97.33, Performance: Outstanding\n```",
