  "prompt": "Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple program that uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints each number:\n\n```python\n# Define the range of numbers\nnumbers = range(1, 11)\n\n# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers and print each one\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line.\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `range(1, 11)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 10.\n2. The `for` loop iterates through this sequence of numbers, assigning each number to the variable `number` in turn.\n3. Inside the loop, the `print(number)` statement prints the current value of `number` to the console.\n\nYou can also write this program in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nfor number in range(1, 11):\n    print(number)\n```\n\nThis version of the program does exactly the same thing as the previous one, but in a single line of code.",
