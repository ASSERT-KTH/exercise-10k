  "answer": "**Word Frequency Calculator**\n=====================================\n\nThis program calculates the frequency of each word in a given text. It uses a dictionary to store the words and their corresponding frequencies.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_word_frequency(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the frequency of each word in a given text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The input text.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are their frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the text to lowercase and remove punctuation\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)\n\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = text.split()\n\n    # Calculate the frequency of each word\n    frequency = Counter(words)\n\n    return frequency\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    text = \"This is an example sentence. This sentence is just an example.\"\n    frequency = calculate_word_frequency(text)\n\n    # Print the word frequencies\n    print(\"Word Frequencies:\")\n    for word, count in frequency.items():\n        print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1. The `calculate_word_frequency` function takes a string `text` as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are their frequencies.\n2. The function first converts the text to lowercase and removes punctuation using regular expressions.\n3. It then splits the text into words using the `split` method.\n4. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to calculate the frequency of each word.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_word_frequency` function with an example text.\n6. The word frequencies are printed to the console.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nWord Frequencies:\nthis: 2\nis: 2\nan: 2\nexample: 2\nsentence: 2\njust: 1\n```",
