  "prompt": "Create a program that determines a car's insurance rate based on its make, model, and year. The program should use if/else statements to determine the insurance rate.",
  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that uses if/else statements to determine a car's insurance rate based on its make, model, and year:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_insurance_rate(make, model, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the insurance rate of a car based on its make, model, and year.\n\n    Args:\n        make (str): The make of the car.\n        model (str): The model of the car.\n        year (int): The year of the car.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The insurance rate of the car.\n    \"\"\"\n    insurance_rate = 0\n\n    if make == \"Toyota\":\n        if model == \"Corolla\":\n            if year >= 2015:\n                insurance_rate = 1200\n            else:\n                insurance_rate = 1000\n        elif model == \"Camry\":\n            if year >= 2015:\n                insurance_rate = 1500\n            else:\n                insurance_rate = 1200\n        else:\n            insurance_rate = 1000\n    elif make == \"Honda\":\n        if model == \"Civic\":\n            if year >= 2015:\n                insurance_rate = 1200\n            else:\n                insurance_rate = 1000\n        elif model == \"Accord\":\n            if year >= 2015:\n                insurance_rate = 1500\n            else:\n                insurance_rate = 1200\n        else:\n            insurance_rate = 1000\n    elif make == \"Ford\":\n        if model == \"Fusion\":\n            if year >= 2015:\n                insurance_rate = 1200\n            else:\n                insurance_rate = 1000\n        elif model == \"Mustang\":\n            if year >= 2015:\n                insurance_rate = 2000\n            else:\n                insurance_rate = 1500\n        else:\n            insurance_rate = 1000\n    else:\n        insurance_rate = 1500\n\n    return insurance_rate\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Car Insurance Rate Calculator\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n\n    make = input(\"Enter the make of the car: \")\n    model = input(\"Enter the model of the car: \")\n    year = int(input(\"Enter the year of the car: \"))\n\n    insurance_rate = calculate_insurance_rate(make, model, year)\n\n    print(f\"The insurance rate for your {year} {make} {model} is ${insurance_rate} per year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `calculate_insurance_rate` function takes in the make, model, and year of the car as input and returns the insurance rate. The insurance rate is determined based on the make, model, and year of the car using if/else statements. The `main` function gets the user's input and prints out the calculated insurance rate.\n\nNote: The insurance rates used in this program are just examples and may not reflect real-world insurance rates.",
