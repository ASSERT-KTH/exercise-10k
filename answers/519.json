  "answer": "**Permutation Generator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program generates all permutations of a given list using recursion and backtracking.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_permutations(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate all permutations of a given list.\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list): The input list.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a permutation of the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if the list is empty or contains only one element\n    if len(lst) <= 1:\n        return [lst]\n\n    permutations = []\n    for i, elem in enumerate(lst):\n        # Choose the current element as the first element of the permutation\n        remaining_list = lst[:i] + lst[i+1:]\n        for p in generate_permutations(remaining_list):\n            permutations.append([elem] + p)\n\n    return permutations\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    input_list = [1, 2, 3]\n    permutations = generate_permutations(input_list)\n    print(\"Permutations of\", input_list, \":\")\n    for i, p in enumerate(permutations):\n        print(f\"Permutation {i+1}: {p}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `generate_permutations` function takes a list as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist is a permutation of the input list.\n2. The base case is when the input list is empty or contains only one element, in which case the function returns a list containing the input list itself.\n3. For each element in the input list, the function recursively generates permutations of the remaining elements (i.e., the input list without the current element).\n4. The function then combines the current element with each permutation of the remaining elements to form a new permutation.\n5. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `generate_permutations` function with an example input list.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nPermutations of [1, 2, 3] :\nPermutation 1: [1, 2, 3]\nPermutation 2: [1, 3, 2]\nPermutation 3: [2, 1, 3]\nPermutation 4: [2, 3, 1]\nPermutation 5: [3, 1, 2]\nPermutation 6: [3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nNote that the number of permutations of a list of length `n` is `n!` (factorial), which can grow very large for large input lists. This program is suitable for small to medium-sized input lists.",
