  "answer": "**Calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using a While Loop**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following code calculates the GCD of two given numbers using the Euclidean algorithm and a while loop.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm and a while loop.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (int): The first number.\n        num2 (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure num1 is the larger number\n    if num2 > num1:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1\n\n    while num2 != 0:\n        # Store the remainder of num1 divided by num2\n        remainder = num1 % num2\n        # Update num1 to be the previous num2\n        num1 = num2\n        # Update num2 to be the remainder\n        num2 = remainder\n\n    return num1\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 48\nnum2 = 18\ngcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The function `calculate_gcd` takes two integers `num1` and `num2` as input.\n2.  It first checks if `num2` is greater than `num1` and swaps them if necessary to ensure that `num1` is the larger number.\n3.  The function then enters a while loop, which continues as long as `num2` is not zero.\n4.  Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `num1` divided by `num2` using the modulus operator (`%`).\n5.  It then updates `num1` to be the previous `num2` and `num2` to be the remainder.\n6.  Once `num2` becomes zero, the loop exits, and the function returns `num1`, which is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n### Output\n\nWhen you run this code with `num1 = 48` and `num2 = 18`, it calculates and prints the GCD of these two numbers:\n\n```\nThe GCD of 48 and 18 is: 6\n```",
