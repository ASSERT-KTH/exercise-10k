  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the frequency of each character in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        input_string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = count_character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequency:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `count_character_frequency` function iterates over each character in the input string.\n2. For each character, it checks if the character is already in the `frequency_dict`.\n3. If the character is in the dictionary, it increments the frequency by 1. If not, it adds the character to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.\n4. The `main` function takes a string as input from the user, calls the `count_character_frequency` function, and prints the character frequencies.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Input: \"Hello, World!\"\n* Output:\n```\nCharacter Frequency:\nH: 1\ne: 1\nl: 3\no: 2\n,: 1\n : 1\nW: 1\nr: 1\nd: 1\n!: 1\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program is case-sensitive, so 'a' and 'A' are treated as different characters.\n* This program also counts spaces and punctuation as characters. If you want to ignore these, you can modify the `count_character_frequency` function to skip them.",
