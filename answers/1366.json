  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program to calculate the result of a number raised to a power:\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the result of a number raised to a power.\n\n    Args:\n        base (float): The base number.\n        exponent (float): The exponent to which the base is raised.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return base ** exponent\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the base and exponent from the user\n    base = float(input(\"Enter the base number: \"))\n    exponent = float(input(\"Enter the exponent: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the result\n    result = power(base, exponent)\n    print(f\"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Program Works\n\n1. The `power` function takes two arguments: `base` and `exponent`, and returns the result of `base` raised to the power of `exponent`.\n2. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the base and exponent.\n3. The `power` function is called with the user's input, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.\n4. The result is then displayed to the user.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate 2^3: Enter `2` as the base and `3` as the exponent. The program will output `8.0`.\n* Calculate 4^0.5: Enter `4` as the base and `0.5` as the exponent. The program will output `2.0`.\n* Calculate -2^3: Enter `-2` as the base and `3` as the exponent. The program will output `-8.0`.",
