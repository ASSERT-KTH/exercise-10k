  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all vowels removed. The function should also be able to handle strings with both uppercase and lowercase letters. Additionally, it should be able to handle strings with numbers and special characters.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a solution to create a function that removes vowels from a given string, handling both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters. This solution aims to provide a clear, step-by-step approach to achieve the desired outcome. Here is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_vowels(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input, removes all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) \n    and returns the resulting string. It can handle strings with numbers and special characters.\n\n    Parameters:\n    input_string (str): The input string from which vowels are to be removed.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The input string with all vowels removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we define a string of all lowercase and uppercase vowels\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n\n    # Then, we use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string\n    # We check if the character is not a vowel using the 'not in' operator\n    # If the character is not a vowel, we include it in our new list\n    no_vowels = [char for char in input_string if char not in vowels]\n\n    # Finally, we use the 'join' method to concatenate all characters in our list into a single string\n    # We return this string as the result\n    return ''.join(no_vowels)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `remove_vowels` starts by defining a string `vowels` containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels, which will be used as a reference to identify and remove vowels from the input string.\n* It then utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each character `char` in the `input_string`, checking if the character is not a vowel using the `not in` operator. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the new list `no_vowels`.\n* Finally, the function uses the `join` method to concatenate all characters in the `no_vowels` list into a single string, which is then returned as the result.\n* The function is well-documented with a clear description, parameters, and return values, making it easy to understand and use.",
