  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string and a list of strings as input, and returns a list of all anagrams of the string in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses the `sorted` function to sort the characters in each string and compare them to the sorted characters in the input string. If the sorted characters are the same, then the strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n```python\ndef find_anagrams(input_str, str_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds all anagrams of a given string in a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        input_str (str): The string for which anagrams are to be found.\n        str_list (list): A list of strings in which anagrams are to be searched.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of all anagrams of the input string in the given list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Sort the characters in the input string\n    sorted_input = sorted(input_str)\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the anagrams\n    anagrams = []\n\n    # Iterate over each string in the list\n    for string in str_list:\n        # Sort the characters in the current string\n        sorted_string = sorted(string)\n\n        # Check if the sorted strings are equal\n        if sorted_string == sorted_input:\n            # If they are equal, it means the current string is an anagram of the input string\n            anagrams.append(string)\n\n    # Return the list of anagrams\n    return anagrams\n\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_str = \"listen\"\nstr_list = [\"silent\", \"enlist\", \"inlets\", \"abc\", \"def\"]\nprint(find_anagrams(input_str, str_list))  # Output: ['silent', 'enlist', 'inlets']\n```\n\nThis solution works by comparing the sorted characters of each string in the list to the sorted characters of the input string. If the sorted characters are the same, then the strings are anagrams of each other. The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m*log(m)), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the maximum length of a string. This is because the `sorted` function has a time complexity of O(m*log(m)) and we are calling it for each string in the list.\n\nNote: This solution is case-sensitive and considers spaces and punctuation as characters. If you want a case-insensitive solution that ignores spaces and punctuation, you would need to preprocess the strings to remove spaces and punctuation and convert them to lower case before comparing them.",
