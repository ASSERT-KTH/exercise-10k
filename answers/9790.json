  "prompt": "Write a program that reads input from a network connection and processes it.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this using Python and its built-in socket library. This program will create a server that listens for incoming connections, reads data from the client, and then prints out the received data.\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_server(host='127.0.0.1', port=12345):\n    # Create a socket object\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Bind the socket to a specific address and port\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n\n    # Listen for incoming connections\n    server_socket.listen(5)\n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Wait for a connection\n        print(\"Waiting for a connection...\")\n        client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()\n        print(f\"Connected by {address}\")\n\n        # Receive data from the client\n        while True:\n            data = client_socket.recv(1024)\n            if not data:\n                break\n            print(f\"Received: {data.decode()}\")\n\n        # Close the client socket\n        client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_server()\n```\n\nTo test this program, you'll need to create a client that connects to the server and sends data. Here's a simple client example:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef start_client(host='127.0.0.1', port=12345):\n    # Create a socket object\n    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n    # Connect to the server\n    client_socket.connect((host, port))\n    print(f\"Connected to {host}:{port}\")\n\n    # Send data to the server\n    while True:\n        message = input(\"Enter a message: \")\n        if message.lower() == \"quit\":\n            break\n        client_socket.sendall(message.encode())\n\n    # Close the client socket\n    client_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_client()\n```\n\nTo run the program, save the server code in a file (e.g., `server.py`) and the client code in another file (e.g., `client.py`). Then, run the server script first, followed by the client script.\n\n```bash\npython server.py\npython client.py\n```\n\nIn the client window, you can enter messages and press Enter to send them to the server. The server will print out the received messages. To quit the client, type \"quit\" and press Enter.",
