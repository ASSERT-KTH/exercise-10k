  "answer": "**Sorting Algorithm Implementation**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of a basic sorting algorithm, specifically the Bubble Sort algorithm, which can handle a list of any size and is case-insensitive when comparing strings.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of elements in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a flag that will allow the function to terminate early if there's nothing left to sort\n        swapped = False\n\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            # Check if the current element is greater than the next element\n            if isinstance(arr[j], str) and isinstance(arr[j + 1], str):\n                # If both elements are strings, compare them case-insensitively\n                if arr[j].lower() > arr[j + 1].lower():\n                    arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                    swapped = True\n            elif arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                # If the elements are not strings, compare them normally\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the list is sorted and we can terminate early\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    return arr\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", bubble_sort(numbers))\n\n    strings = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Banana\", \"elephant\"]\n    print(\"\\nOriginal list:\", strings)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", bubble_sort(strings))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list `arr` as input and returns the sorted list.\n2.  The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the input list.\n3.  The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n4.  If both elements are strings, the comparison is done case-insensitively by converting both strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method.\n5.  If no swaps are made in the inner loop, the list is already sorted and the function can terminate early.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   Best-case scenario (already sorted list): O(n)\n*   Worst-case scenario (reverse-sorted list): O(n^2)\n*   Average-case scenario: O(n^2)\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The Bubble Sort algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of additional space for the temporary swap variable.",
