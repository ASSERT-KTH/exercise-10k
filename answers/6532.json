  "answer": "**Fibonacci Sequence Generator Function**\n\nThe following function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. This function uses an iterative approach to generate the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n\n    return fib_sequence\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10  # Change this to generate a different number of terms\n    fib_sequence = generate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms: {fib_sequence}\")\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The function starts by checking for base cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, 1, or 2.\n2. For `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).\n3. The function then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` is equal to `n`.\n4. In each iteration of the loop, the function appends the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the end of `fib_sequence`.\n5. Once the loop completes, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
