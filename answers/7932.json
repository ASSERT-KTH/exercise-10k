Run the program.\n2. Enter your income when prompted (e.g., 50000).\n3. Enter the tax rate as a decimal when prompted (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).\n4. The program will display the calculated tax amount and net income.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The tax rate is assumed to be a decimal value (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).\n* The program uses the formula `tax_amount = income * tax_rate` to calculate the tax amount.\n* The `main` function gets user input, calls the `calculate_tax` function, and displays the results.",
