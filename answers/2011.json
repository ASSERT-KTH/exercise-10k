  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a news headline as input and classifies it as either positive, negative, or neutral using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef classify_headline(headline):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classify a news headline as positive, negative, or neutral.\n    \n    Args:\n    headline (str): The news headline to be classified.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The classification of the headline (positive, negative, or neutral).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert the headline to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    headline = headline.lower()\n    \n    # Define lists of positive and negative words\n    positive_words = [\"wins\", \"success\", \"great\", \"good\", \"up\"]\n    negative_words = [\"loss\", \"fail\", \"bad\", \"down\", \"decrease\"]\n    \n    # Initialize a score for the headline\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Check for positive words in the headline\n    for word in positive_words:\n        if word in headline:\n            score += 1\n    \n    # Check for negative words in the headline\n    for word in negative_words:\n        if word in headline:\n            score -= 1\n    \n    # Classify the headline based on the score\n    if score > 0:\n        return \"positive\"\n    elif score < 0:\n        return \"negative\"\n    else:\n        return \"neutral\"\n\n# Test the function with some examples\nheadlines = [\n    \"Company Wins Big Contract\",\n    \"Stock Prices Fall\",\n    \"New Product Launch is Successful\",\n    \"Economic Growth is Down\",\n    \"No Change in Market Trends\"\n]\n\nfor headline in headlines:\n    print(f\"Headline: {headline}, Classification: {classify_headline(headline)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `classify_headline` function takes a `headline` as input and returns its classification as a string.\n2. **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: The `headline` is converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison with positive and negative words.\n3. **Positive and Negative Words**: Lists of `positive_words` and `negative_words` are defined to determine the sentiment of the headline.\n4. **Scoring System**: A `score` variable is initialized to 0 and incremented or decremented based on the presence of positive or negative words in the headline.\n5. **Classification**: The headline is classified as \"positive\" if the `score` is greater than 0, \"negative\" if the `score` is less than 0, and \"neutral\" if the `score` is 0.\n6. **Testing**: The function is tested with a list of example headlines to demonstrate its usage and output.",
