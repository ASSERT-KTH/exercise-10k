  "answer": "**Even Number Sum Calculator**\n================================\n\n### Program Description\n\nThis program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 20, checks if each number is even, and adds it to a running total if it is.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_even_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 21):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            even_sum += i\n    return even_sum\n\ndef main():\n    even_sum = calculate_even_sum()\n    print(f\"The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is: {even_sum}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_even_sum` function initializes a variable `even_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of all even numbers.\n2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, the program checks if the current number `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`).\n4. If the number is even, it is added to the `even_sum`.\n5. After the loop finishes, the function returns the `even_sum`.\n6. In the `main` function, the program calls `calculate_even_sum` and prints the result.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\nThe sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is: 110\n```",
