  "prompt": "Write a program that asks for two numbers and an operator, and then prints out the result of the operation.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Get the numbers and operator from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    operator = input(\"Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform the operation based on the operator\n    if operator == \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif operator == \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif operator == \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif operator == \"/\":\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n            return\n        result = num1 / num2\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, or /.\")\n        return\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"{num1} {operator} {num2} = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  The program starts by asking the user to input two numbers and an operator.\n2.  It then uses an if-elif-else statement to determine which operation to perform based on the operator.\n3.  If the operator is `/`, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero.\n4.  Finally, it prints the result of the operation.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n*   Enter `10` as the first number, `+` as the operator, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.\n*   Enter `20` as the first number, `-` as the operator, and `3` as the second number. The output will be `20 - 3 = 17.0`.\n*   Enter `4` as the first number, `*` as the operator, and `5` as the second number. The output will be `4 * 5 = 20.0`.\n*   Enter `10` as the first number, `/` as the operator, and `2` as the second number. The output will be `10 / 2 = 5.0`.",
