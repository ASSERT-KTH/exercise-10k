  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef power(a, b):\n    return a ** b\n\nresult = power(2, 3)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code defines a function `power` that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number using the exponentiation operator `**`. The function is then called with the arguments `2` and `3`, and the result is stored in the variable `result`. Finally, the value of `result` is printed to the console.",
