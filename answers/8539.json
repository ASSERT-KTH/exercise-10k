  "prompt": "Write a program to calculate the volume of a cone given its radius and height.",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_cone_volume(radius, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the volume of a cone given its radius and height.\n\n    Args:\n        radius (float): The radius of the cone.\n        height (float): The height of the cone.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The volume of the cone.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0 or height < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius and height cannot be negative.\")\n\n    volume = (1.0/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the radius and height from the user\n    radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the cone: \"))\n    height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the cone: \"))\n\n    try:\n        # Calculate and display the volume\n        volume = calculate_cone_volume(radius, height)\n        print(f\"The volume of the cone is: {volume:.2f} cubic units\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   The `calculate_cone_volume` function takes the radius and height of the cone as input and returns its volume.\n*   The formula used to calculate the volume of a cone is `(1/3) * \u03c0 * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height.\n*   In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter the radius and height of the cone.\n*   It then calls the `calculate_cone_volume` function with the provided values and displays the calculated volume.\n*   The program also includes error handling to ensure that the radius and height are not negative.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   To calculate the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 units and a height of 10 units, you can run the program and enter `5` as the radius and `10` as the height when prompted.\n*   The program will then display the calculated volume of the cone.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1.  Define a function `calculate_cone_volume` that takes the radius and height as input and returns the volume.\n2.  Implement the formula for calculating the volume of a cone inside the function.\n3.  Create a `main` function to get the radius and height from the user and call the `calculate_cone_volume` function.\n4.  Handle potential errors, such as negative radius or height, by raising a `ValueError`.\n5.  Run the program and enter the desired radius and height when prompted to see the calculated volume.",
