  "answer": "**Least Common Multiple (LCM) Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two given numbers using a basic algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm**\n------------\n\nThe algorithm used in this program is as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Use the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)` to calculate the LCM.\n\n**Code**\n-----\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef calculate_lcm(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The LCM of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(a, b)\n    lcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n    return lcm\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    lcm = calculate_lcm(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Find the LCM of 12 and 15:\n    *   Input: `num1 = 12`, `num2 = 15`\n    *   Output: `The LCM of 12 and 15 is 60`\n*   Find the LCM of 24 and 30:\n    *   Input: `num1 = 24`, `num2 = 30`\n    *   Output: `The LCM of 24 and 30 is 120`\n\n**Notes**\n-----\n\n*   This program uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers.\n*   The `calculate_lcm` function uses the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)` to calculate the LCM, which is a direct consequence of the definition of the LCM.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_lcm` function to find the LCM of two user-input numbers.",
