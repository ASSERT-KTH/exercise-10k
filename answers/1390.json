  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to generate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that generates the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence\na, b = 0, 1\n\n# Print the first two numbers\nprint(a, b, end=' ')\n\n# Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of terms\ni = 2\n\n# Generate the next 8 numbers in the sequence\nwhile i < 10:\n    # Calculate the next number as the sum of the previous two\n    next_number = a + b\n    \n    # Print the next number\n    print(next_number, end=' ')\n    \n    # Update the previous two numbers for the next iteration\n    a, b = b, next_number\n    \n    # Increment the counter\n    i += 1\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis program starts by initializing the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: `a` and `b`. It then enters a while loop that continues until it has generated 10 numbers in the sequence.\n\n Inside the loop, it calculates the next number in the sequence as the sum of the previous two numbers (`a` and `b`). It then prints this next number and updates the values of `a` and `b` for the next iteration.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:\n```\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34\n```\n\n### Full Code with Main Function\n\nHere's the full code with a main function:\n\n```python\ndef generate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms to generate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence\n    a, b = 0, 1\n\n    # Print the first two numbers\n    print(a, b, end=' ')\n\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of terms\n    i = 2\n\n    # Generate the next n-2 numbers in the sequence\n    while i < n:\n        # Calculate the next number as the sum of the previous two\n        next_number = a + b\n        \n        # Print the next number\n        print(next_number, end=' ')\n        \n        # Update the previous two numbers for the next iteration\n        a, b = b, next_number\n        \n        # Increment the counter\n        i += 1\n\n\ndef main():\n    n = 10  # Change this to generate a different number of terms\n    print(f\"First {n} numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:\")\n    generate_fibonacci(n)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```",
