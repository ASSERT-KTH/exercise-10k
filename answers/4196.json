  "answer": "**Simple Bank Account Simulator**\n=====================================\n\nThis Python program simulates a simple bank account system, allowing users to interact with it by depositing, withdrawing, and checking their balance.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a bank account with an optional initial balance.\n\n        Args:\n            initial_balance (float, optional): Initial balance. Defaults to 0.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.balance = initial_balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Deposit a specified amount into the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to deposit.\n        \"\"\"\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            print(f\"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid deposit amount.\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        \"\"\"\n        Withdraw a specified amount from the account.\n\n        Args:\n            amount (float): Amount to withdraw.\n        \"\"\"\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            print(f\"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n        elif amount <= 0:\n            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds.\")\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Display the current account balance.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(f\"Current balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = BankAccount()\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nBank Account Simulator\")\n        print(\"1. Deposit\")\n        print(\"2. Withdraw\")\n        print(\"3. Check Balance\")\n        print(\"4. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to deposit: \"))\n            account.deposit(amount)\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            amount = float(input(\"Enter amount to withdraw: \"))\n            account.withdraw(amount)\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            account.check_balance()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Exiting simulator.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n-----------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose an option from the menu:\n\t* Deposit: Enter an amount to deposit into the account.\n\t* Withdraw: Enter an amount to withdraw from the account.\n\t* Check Balance: Display the current account balance.\n\t* Exit: Exit the simulator.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you choose to exit.\n\n**Notes**\n-------\n\n* The `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account's balance and provides methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n* The `main` function creates a `BankAccount` instance and provides a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction.\n* The program uses a `while` loop to continuously display the menu and process user input until the user chooses to exit.",
