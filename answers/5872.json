  "answer": "**Binary Search Algorithm Implementation**\n==========================================\n\n### Overview\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and searching for the element in one of the two halves until it is found.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a binary search on a sorted list to find the index of a target element.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the sorted list, respectively.\n2.  Calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.\n3.  Compare the middle element `sorted_list[mid]` with the target element `target`.\n    *   If they are equal, return the middle index `mid`.\n    *   If the middle element is less than the target, update `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.\n    *   If the middle element is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.\n4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until `low` is greater than `high`.\n5.  If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted list. This is because the algorithm divides the search interval in half at each step, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the target element, regardless of the size of the input list.",
