  "answer": "**Longest Common Prefix Problem**\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven an array of strings, find the longest common prefix.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere is a Python solution using the built-in `zip` function and `set` data structure:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix in a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs (list): A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n\n    prefix = []\n    for chars in zip(*strs):\n        if len(set(chars)) == 1:\n            prefix.append(chars[0])\n        else:\n            break\n\n    return \"\".join(prefix)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]))  # Output: \"fl\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"]))  # Output: \"\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix([\"intership\", \"intern\", \"interior\"]))  # Output: \"inter\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Check for Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, return an empty string.\n2.  **Initialize Prefix**: Initialize an empty list `prefix` to store the common prefix characters.\n3.  **Iterate Through Characters**: Use `zip(*strs)` to iterate through the characters of the input strings in parallel.\n4.  **Check for Common Character**: For each set of characters, check if all characters are the same by converting them to a `set` and checking if the length is 1. If they are the same, append the character to the `prefix` list.\n5.  **Break on Non-Common Character**: If the characters are not the same, break the loop as the common prefix has ended.\n6.  **Return the Prefix**: Join the characters in the `prefix` list to form the longest common prefix string and return it.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the input list and m is the average length of the strings. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the length of the longest common prefix.",
