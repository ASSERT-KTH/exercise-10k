  "prompt": "Write a program that prints a pattern of stars (*) using a for loop.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that prints a pattern of stars (*) using a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of rows\nrows = 5\n\n# Print the pattern\nfor i in range(rows):\n    # Print spaces\n    for j in range(rows - i - 1):\n        print(' ', end=' ')\n    \n    # Print stars\n    for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n        print('*', end=' ')\n    \n    # Move to the next line\n    print()\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the following pattern:\n```\n    * \n   * * * \n  * * * * * \n * * * * * * * \n* * * * * * * * * \n```\n\nYou can adjust the `rows` variable to change the size of the pattern.\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The outer loop (`for i in range(rows):`) controls the number of rows in the pattern.\n2. The first inner loop (`for j in range(rows - i - 1):`) prints the spaces needed to center the pattern.\n3. The second inner loop (`for k in range(2 * i + 1):`) prints the stars for each row.\n4. The `print()` statement after the inner loops moves to the next line.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* You can adjust the `rows` variable to print patterns of different sizes.\n* You can modify the program to print different patterns by changing the logic of the inner loops.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. Define the number of rows you want in your pattern.\n2. Create an outer loop to control the number of rows.\n3. Inside the outer loop, create an inner loop to print the spaces needed to center the pattern.\n4. Create another inner loop to print the stars for each row.\n5. Use the `print()` statement to move to the next line after each row.",
