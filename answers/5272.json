  "prompt": "Write a program to determine whether a given number is part of the Fibonacci sequence using conditional statements",
  "answer": "Here's an example Python program that checks if a given number is part of the Fibonacci sequence:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a perfect square\"\"\"\n    s = int(math.sqrt(x))\n    return s*s == x\n\ndef is_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a Fibonacci number\"\"\"\n    return is_perfect_square(5*n*n + 4) or is_perfect_square(5*n*n - 4)\n\ndef main():\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_fibonacci(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a Fibonacci number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a Fibonacci number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The `is_perfect_square` function checks if a number is a perfect square by taking its square root, rounding down to the nearest integer, and then squaring that integer. If the result is equal to the original number, then it's a perfect square.\n2. The `is_fibonacci` function uses a mathematical property of Fibonacci numbers: a number is Fibonacci if either (5*n^2 + 4) or (5*n^2 \u2013 4) is a perfect square. This property is derived from the equation `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(n)` is the nth Fibonacci number.\n3. In the `main` function, we take user input and check if the number is a Fibonacci number using the `is_fibonacci` function. If it is, we print a message indicating that it's a Fibonacci number. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it's not a Fibonacci number.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* Input: `13` Output: `13 is a Fibonacci number.`\n* Input: `14` Output: `14 is not a Fibonacci number.`\n* Input: `21` Output: `21 is a Fibonacci number.`\n\nNote that this program uses a mathematical property to check if a number is a Fibonacci number, rather than generating the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number. This makes it more efficient for large inputs.",
