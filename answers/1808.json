  "prompt": "Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input, using conditional statements to determine the operation",
  "answer": "Here's an example of how you can create such a program in Python:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Get user input for the operation\n    print(\"Basic Arithmetic Operations\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, 4): \")\n\n    # Get user input for the numbers\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Perform the operation based on the user's choice\n    if choice == '1':\n        print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n    elif choice == '2':\n        print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n    elif choice == '3':\n        print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n    elif choice == '4':\n        # Check for division by zero\n        if num2 == 0:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **User Input**: The program starts by prompting the user to choose an arithmetic operation and input two numbers.\n2.  **Conditional Statements**: The `if-elif-else` statements are used to determine which operation to perform based on the user's choice.\n3.  **Arithmetic Operations**: The program then performs the chosen operation on the two input numbers and prints the result.\n4.  **Division by Zero Check**: Before performing division, the program checks if the second number is zero to prevent a division by zero error.\n5.  **Error Handling**: If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an error message.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   **Addition**: Choose option 1, enter two numbers (e.g., 5 and 3), and the program will output `5 + 3 = 8.0`.\n*   **Subtraction**: Choose option 2, enter two numbers (e.g., 10 and 4), and the program will output `10 - 4 = 6.0`.\n*   **Multiplication**: Choose option 3, enter two numbers (e.g., 7 and 2), and the program will output `7 * 2 = 14.0`.\n*   **Division**: Choose option 4, enter two numbers (e.g., 9 and 3), and the program will output `9 / 3 = 3.0`. If you enter 0 as the second number, it will display an error message.",
