  "answer": "**Character Frequency Counter**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program takes a string as input and returns the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef character_frequency(input_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary where the keys are the characters in the input string\n    and the values are their corresponding frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[char] = 1\n    return frequency_dict\n\ndef main():\n    input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    frequency_dict = character_frequency(input_string)\n    print(\"Character Frequencies:\")\n    for char, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{char}: {frequency}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `character_frequency` function initializes an empty dictionary to store the character frequencies.\n2. It then iterates over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is already in the dictionary, it increments the corresponding value by 1.\n4. If the character is not in the dictionary, it adds the character with a frequency of 1.\n5. The `main` function prompts the user for a string, calls the `character_frequency` function, and prints the resulting dictionary.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n* Input: `hello`\n* Output:\n```\nCharacter Frequencies:\nh: 1\ne: 1\nl: 2\no: 1\n```\n\n### Advice\n\n* This program uses a dictionary to store the character frequencies, which provides fast lookups and efficient storage.\n* The program handles both uppercase and lowercase characters as distinct characters.\n* If you want to ignore case, you can convert the input string to lowercase or uppercase before processing it.",
