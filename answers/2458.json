  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all elements that are common to both lists.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\ndef commonElements(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a list of elements that are common to both input lists, a and b.\n\n    :param a: The first input list\n    :param b: The second input list\n    :return: A new list containing the common elements\n    \"\"\"\n    res = []\n    for i in a:\n        if i in b:\n            res.append(i)\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7]\n    b = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]\n    res = commonElements(a, b)\n    print(\"Common elements:\", res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nI've written the code exactly as described in the specification, including the docstring for the `commonElements` function, the implementation of the function, the `main` function, and the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.",
