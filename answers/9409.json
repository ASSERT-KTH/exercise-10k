  "answer": "Here's a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n    \n    while len(fib_sequence) < n:\n        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])\n    \n    return fib_sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nnum_terms = 10\nprint(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms:\")\nprint(fibonacci(num_terms))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `fibonacci(n)` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.\n2.  We initialize the `fib_sequence` list with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n3.  We use a while loop to append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the `fib_sequence` list until it reaches `n` terms.\n4.  Finally, we return the `fib_sequence` list.\n\nYou can modify the `num_terms` variable to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a different number of terms.\n\nWhen you run this code with `num_terms = 10`, it will print the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10 terms:\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]\n```",
