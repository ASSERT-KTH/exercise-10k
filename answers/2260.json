  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes an integer as input and returns whether it is a prime number or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n    # Check if the number is prime\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime.\n2. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns False.\n3. It then checks if `n` is divisible by any number up to its square root.\n4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False.\n5. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns True.\n6. The `main` function gets user input, checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: 25\n  Output: 25 is not a prime number.\n* Input: 23\n  Output: 23 is a prime number.\n* Input: 37\n  Output: 37 is a prime number.\n* Input: 48\n  Output: 48 is not a prime number.\n\n### Note\n\nThis program uses a trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small to moderate-sized integers. For larger integers, more efficient algorithms such as the Miller-Rabin primality test may be necessary.",
