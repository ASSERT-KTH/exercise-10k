  "answer": "**Quantity Discount Calculator**\n=====================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of an item after applying a quantity discount. The discount is applied based on the quantity of items purchased.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(price, quantity, discount_thresholds):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of an item after applying a quantity discount.\n\n    Args:\n        price (float): The price of a single item.\n        quantity (int): The quantity of items purchased.\n        discount_thresholds (dict): A dictionary of discount thresholds and corresponding discounts.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total cost of the items after applying the discount.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_cost = price * quantity\n\n    # Apply discount based on quantity\n    for threshold, discount in discount_thresholds.items():\n        if quantity >= threshold:\n            total_cost *= (1 - discount / 100)\n            break\n\n    return total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    # Define discount thresholds and corresponding discounts\n    discount_thresholds = {\n        10: 5,  # 5% discount for 10 or more items\n        20: 10,  # 10% discount for 20 or more items\n        50: 15   # 15% discount for 50 or more items\n    }\n\n    # Get user input\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the price of a single item: \"))\n    quantity = int(input(\"Enter the quantity of items purchased: \"))\n\n    # Calculate total cost\n    total_cost = calculate_total_cost(price, quantity, discount_thresholds)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the total cost of 15 items with a price of $10 each:\n\t+ Input: `price = 10`, `quantity = 15`\n\t+ Output: `Total cost: $142.50` (10% discount applied)\n* Calculate the total cost of 5 items with a price of $20 each:\n\t+ Input: `price = 20`, `quantity = 5`\n\t+ Output: `Total cost: $100.00` (no discount applied)\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_total_cost` function takes in the price of a single item, the quantity of items purchased, and a dictionary of discount thresholds and corresponding discounts.\n2. The function calculates the total cost of the items without discount.\n3. It then applies the discount based on the quantity of items purchased by iterating through the discount thresholds and corresponding discounts.\n4. The `main` function defines the discount thresholds and corresponding discounts, gets user input for the price and quantity, and calculates the total cost using the `calculate_total_cost` function.\n5. The result is printed to the console.",
