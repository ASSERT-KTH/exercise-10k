  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a student's score as input and calculates their grade based on the following scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Use if/else statements to determine the grade.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that calculates a student's grade based on their score:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the grade\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if score < 0 or score > 100:\n        return \"Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100.\"\n\n    # Use if/else statements to determine the grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    # Ask the user for their score\n    score = float(input(\"Enter your score: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the grade\n    grade = calculate_grade(score)\n    print(\"Your grade is:\", grade)\n\n# Run the main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this program, the `calculate_grade` function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the given scale. The `main` function asks the user for their score, calculates the grade using the `calculate_grade` function, and prints the result.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nEnter your score: 85\nYour grade is: B\n```\n\nNote that this program uses `float` to allow for decimal scores, but it doesn't handle non-numeric input. If you want to add error handling for non-numeric input, you can use a `try`/`except` block to catch the `ValueError` exception that's raised when the `float` function can't convert the input to a number.",
