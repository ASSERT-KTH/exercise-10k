  "answer": "**Random Number Guessing Game**\n================================\n\nBelow is a Python function that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries the user has made\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the random number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries the user has made\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is correct\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    random_number_guessing_game()\n```\n\n**How the Code Works**\n------------------------\n\n1. The `random_number_guessing_game` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n2. The function then enters a loop where it continually asks the user for their guess.\n3. If the user types \"quit\", the function reveals the number and ends the game.\n4. The function attempts to convert the user's guess to an integer. If this fails, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.\n5. If the user's guess is less than the number to guess, the function prints \"Too low!\". If the guess is greater than the number to guess, it prints \"Too high!\".\n6. If the user's guess is equal to the number to guess, the function congratulates the user and ends the game.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-------------------------\n\n* To make the game more challenging, you can increase the range of the random number or add a time limit for the user to make their guesses.\n* To make the game easier, you can provide more hints or give the user a limited number of \"free\" guesses that don't count towards their total number of tries.\n* You can also add a scoring system where the user earns points for guessing the number correctly, and loses points for making incorrect guesses.",
