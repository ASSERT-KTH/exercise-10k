  "prompt": "Write a function that takes a callback function as an argument and executes it.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that takes another function as an argument and executes it, providing a clear and structured approach to achieve this functionality. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define a function that takes another function as an argument and executes it\ndef execute_callback(callback):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes another function as an argument and executes it.\n\n    Args:\n        callback (function): The function to be executed.\n\n    Returns:\n        result: The result of the executed function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the provided argument is callable (i.e., it's a function)\n    if callable(callback):\n        # If the argument is callable, execute it and return the result\n        return callback()\n    else:\n        # If the argument is not callable, raise a TypeError with a descriptive message\n        raise TypeError(\"The provided argument is not a function.\")\n\n# Example usage:\ndef example_callback():\n    # This is an example function that will be passed to the execute_callback function\n    print(\"The callback function was executed.\")\n    return \"Callback executed successfully.\"\n\n# Execute the example_callback function using the execute_callback function\nresult = execute_callback(example_callback)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The `execute_callback` function is defined to take another function `callback` as an argument and checks if it's callable using the `callable()` function. If it is, the function executes the `callback` and returns its result.\n* The function includes a check to ensure the provided argument is a function, raising a `TypeError` if it's not, to prevent potential errors.\n* An example usage is provided with the `example_callback` function, demonstrating how to pass a function to `execute_callback` and handle its return value.\n* The `execute_callback` function is designed to be reusable, allowing you to pass any function as an argument and execute it, making it a flexible and useful tool in various programming scenarios.",
