  "answer": "**Pattern Finder**\n=======================\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven a string and a pattern, find all occurrences of the pattern in the string and return their starting indices.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe will use Python's built-in `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_pattern(string, pattern):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string and return their starting indices.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        pattern (str): The pattern to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of starting indices of the pattern in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use re.finditer to find all occurrences of the pattern\n    matches = re.finditer(pattern, string)\n    \n    # Extract the starting indices of the matches\n    indices = [match.start() for match in matches]\n    \n    return indices\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"abababab\"\npattern = \"ab\"\nprint(find_pattern(string, pattern))  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. Import the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions.\n2. Define a function `find_pattern` that takes a string and a pattern as input.\n3. Use `re.finditer` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string. This returns an iterator yielding match objects for every occurrence.\n4. Extract the starting indices of the matches using a list comprehension.\n5. Return the list of starting indices.\n\n### Notes\n\n* This solution assumes that the pattern is a valid regular expression. If the pattern is not a valid regular expression, `re.finditer` will raise a `SyntaxError`.\n* The `re.finditer` function returns an iterator, which means that it yields match objects on the fly, without storing them all in memory at once. This makes it efficient for large strings.\n* The `start` method of a match object returns the starting index of the match in the string.",
