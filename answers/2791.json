  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a list and a sublist as input, and returns True if the sublist is found in the list, and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll outline a solution to check if a sublist exists within a larger list and guide you through implementing the function. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_sublist_found(main_list, sub_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a sublist is present in a main list.\n    \n    Args:\n        main_list (list): The main list to be searched.\n        sub_list (list): The sublist to be found.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the sublist is found, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We will iterate over the main list with a sliding window of size equal to the length of the sub list\n    # This is because we need to check every possible sub list of the main list that has the same length as the given sub list\n    \n    # First, we get the length of the main list and the sub list\n    main_list_len = len(main_list)\n    \n    # We also get the length of the sub list\n    sub_list_len = len(sub_list)\n    \n    # If the sub list is empty, it is considered to be a sublist of any list\n    if sub_list_len == 0:\n        return True\n    \n    # If the main list is empty or its length is less than the length of the sub list, the sub list cannot be a sublist of the main list\n    if main_list_len < sub_list_len:\n        return False\n    \n    # Now, we iterate over the main list with a sliding window of size equal to the length of the sub list\n    for i in range(main_list_len - sub_list_len + 1):\n        \n        # For each window, we check if it is equal to the sub list\n        if main_list[i:i + sub_list_len] == sub_list:\n            \n            # If we find a match, we immediately return True\n            return True\n    \n    # If we have checked all windows and haven't found a match, we return False\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_sublist_found` checks if a `sub_list` is present in a `main_list` by iterating over the `main_list` with a sliding window of size equal to the length of the `sub_list`.\n* It first checks for edge cases where the `sub_list` is empty (considered a sublist of any list) or the `main_list` is empty or shorter than the `sub_list` (in which case the `sub_list` cannot be a sublist).\n* The function then iterates over the `main_list`, comparing each window of the same length as the `sub_list` to the `sub_list` itself, returning `True` upon finding a match.\n* If no match is found after checking all windows, the function returns `False`.",
