  "answer": "**Missing Number Problem**\n==========================\n\nThe missing number problem is a common problem in computer science where you are given a sequence of numbers and need to find the missing number in the sequence.\n\n**Solution**\n------------\n\nHere is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented solution to the missing number problem:\n\n### Approach\n\nWe will use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the missing number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a sequence of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (list): A list of integers representing a sequence of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number in the sequence.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input sequence is not a list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(sequence, list) or not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in sequence):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input sequence must be a list of integers\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\n    n = len(sequence) + 1\n    expected_sum = (n * (min(sequence) + max(sequence))) // 2\n\n    # Calculate the actual sum of the sequence\n    actual_sum = sum(sequence)\n\n    # The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum\n    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum\n\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage:\nsequence = [1, 2, 3, 5]\nmissing_number = find_missing_number(sequence)\nprint(f\"The missing number in the sequence is: {missing_number}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The function `find_missing_number` takes a list of integers as input and returns the missing number in the sequence.\n2. It first checks if the input sequence is a list of integers and raises a `ValueError` if it is not.\n3. It then calculates the expected sum of the sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (min + max) / 2`, where `n` is the length of the sequence plus one (to account for the missing number).\n4. It calculates the actual sum of the sequence using the `sum` function.\n5. The missing number is then calculated as the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n6. Finally, the function returns the missing number.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence. This is because we need to iterate over the sequence to calculate the sum.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because we only need to store a few variables to calculate the missing number.",
