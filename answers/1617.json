  "answer": "**Math Expression Evaluator**\n================================\n\nThis program uses the `eval()` function in Python to evaluate mathematical expressions.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_expression(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate a mathematical expression.\n\n    Args:\n        expression (str): The mathematical expression to evaluate.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    expression = input(\"Enter a mathematical expression: \")\n    result = evaluate_expression(expression)\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `evaluate_expression()` function takes a string `expression` as input.\n2. It uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the expression.\n3. If the evaluation is successful, it returns the result as a float.\n4. If an error occurs during evaluation (e.g., invalid syntax), it catches the exception, prints an error message, and returns `None`.\n5. The `main()` function demonstrates example usage, prompting the user to enter a mathematical expression and printing the result.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Enter a simple arithmetic expression: `2 + 3`\n* Enter an expression with variables: `x = 5; x * 2` (note: this will not work as expected, as `eval()` does not support variable assignments)\n* Enter an expression with functions: `math.sqrt(4)` (note: this will not work as expected, as `eval()` does not support importing modules)\n\n**Security Note**\n-----------------\n\nThe `eval()` function can pose a security risk if used with untrusted input, as it can evaluate arbitrary code. In this example, we assume the input is trusted. If you plan to use this code with untrusted input, consider using a safer alternative, such as a parsing library or a sandboxed environment.",
