  "answer": "**Secure Input Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that uses SSL encryption to securely receive input from the user and prints out the results.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.6+\n* `ssl` library (built-in)\n* `socket` library (built-in)\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport socket\nimport ssl\n\ndef secure_input(host='localhost', port=12345):\n    \"\"\"\n    Establishes a secure SSL connection and receives input from the user.\n    \n    Args:\n        host (str): The hostname or IP address to connect to.\n        port (int): The port number to connect to.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The user's input.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create an SSL context\n    context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)\n    context.load_verify_locations('server.crt')  # Load the server's certificate\n    \n    # Create a socket object\n    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET)\n    client_socket.settimeout(10)  # Set a timeout of 10 seconds\n    \n    # Wrap the socket with an SSL context\n    ssl_socket = context.wrap_socket(client_socket, server_hostname=host)\n    \n    # Connect to the server\n    ssl_socket.connect((host, port))\n    \n    # Receive input from the user\n    input_data = ssl_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')\n    \n    # Close the SSL socket\n    ssl_socket.close()\n    \n    return input_data\n\ndef main():\n    host = 'localhost'\n    port = 12345\n    \n    # Create an SSL server\n    context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)\n    context.load_cert_chain('server.crt', 'server.key')  # Load the server's certificate and private key\n    \n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET)\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n    server_socket.listen(1)\n    \n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}...\")\n    \n    client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()\n    ssl_socket = context.wrap_socket(client_socket, server_side=True)\n    \n    print(\"Secure connection established.\")\n    \n    # Send a prompt to the client\n    ssl_socket.send(b\"Enter your input: \")\n    \n    # Receive input from the client\n    input_data = ssl_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')\n    \n    print(f\"Received input: {input_data}\")\n    \n    # Close the SSL socket\n    ssl_socket.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `secure_input` function establishes a secure SSL connection to a server, receives input from the user, and returns the input.\n2. The `main` function creates an SSL server, listens for incoming connections, and receives input from the client.\n3. The server sends a prompt to the client, receives the input, and prints it out.\n\n### Note\n\n* This example assumes you have a server certificate (`server.crt`) and private key (`server.key`) in the same directory as the script.\n* The client will need to trust the server's certificate in order to establish a secure connection.\n* This is a basic example and does not include any error handling or security measures beyond what is provided by the `ssl` library.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Generate a server certificate and private key using tools like OpenSSL.\n2. Run the script as a server by executing `python secure_input.py`.\n3. Connect to the server using a tool like `telnet` or an SSL client.\n4. Enter your input when prompted.\n5. The server will print out the received input.",
