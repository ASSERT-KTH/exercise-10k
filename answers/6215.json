  "answer": "**Sorting a List of Integers**\n================================\n\nHere is a simple function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list.\n\n```python\ndef sort_list(input_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers in ascending order.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(input_list)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sort_list(numbers))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `sort_list` that takes a list of integers as input.\n*   Inside the function, we use Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the list in ascending order.\n*   The sorted list is then returned by the function.\n*   In the example usage, we create a list of integers, print the original list, sort the list using our function, and print the sorted list.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nOriginal list: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nSorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nThis function uses the Timsort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of items being sorted.",
