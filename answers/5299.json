  "answer": "**Bubble Sort Implementation in Python**\n======================================\n\nBelow is an example implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Python. This program uses a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n\n    # Iterate over the list\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a flag to track if any swaps were made\n        swapped = False\n\n        # Iterate over the list from the first element to the (n-i-1)th element\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]\n                # Set the flag to True\n                swapped = True\n\n        # If no swaps were made in the inner loop, the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return numbers\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n    print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list.\n2.  The outer loop iterates over the list, and the inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n3.  The `swapped` flag is used to track if any swaps were made in the inner loop. If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.\n4.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the `bubble_sort` function to sort a list of numbers.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n------------------\n\nThe time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list. This makes it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort for large lists. However, bubble sort can still be useful for small lists or educational purposes.",
