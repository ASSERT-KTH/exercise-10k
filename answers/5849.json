  "prompt": "Write a program that simulates a traffic light. The program should start with a green light and then change to yellow after 5 seconds, and then change to red after 2 seconds. The program should print out the current color of the light",
  "answer": "**Traffic Light Simulator**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a Python program that simulates a traffic light. It uses the `time` module to create a delay between each color change.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nclass TrafficLight:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.colors = [\"green\", \"yellow\", \"red\"]\n        self.current_color = self.colors[0]\n\n    def change_color(self, new_color, delay):\n        print(f\"The light is {self.current_color}\")\n        time.sleep(delay)\n        self.current_color = new_color\n\n    def run(self):\n        print(\"Traffic light simulator started.\")\n        self.change_color(\"yellow\", 5)\n        self.change_color(\"red\", 2)\n        print(f\"The light is {self.current_color}\")\n\ndef main():\n    traffic_light = TrafficLight()\n    traffic_light.run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How the Program Works**\n-------------------------\n\n1. The `TrafficLight` class is initialized with a list of colors and the current color set to green.\n2. The `change_color` method prints the current color, waits for a specified delay, and then changes the current color.\n3. The `run` method starts the traffic light simulator, changing the color from green to yellow after 5 seconds, and then from yellow to red after 2 seconds.\n4. The `main` function creates a `TrafficLight` object and starts the simulator.\n\n**Example Output**\n------------------\n\n```\nTraffic light simulator started.\nThe light is green\nThe light is yellow\nThe light is red\n```",
