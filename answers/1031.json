  "answer": "### Binary Search Program\n#### Overview\n\nThis program performs a binary search on a sorted list to find a target element. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the list in half and searching for the target element in one of the two halves.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(sorted_list, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a binary search on a sorted list to find a target element.\n\n    Args:\n        sorted_list (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The target element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(sorted_list) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if sorted_list[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n    target = 23\n\n    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `binary_search` function takes a sorted list and a target element as input.\n2. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the list, respectively.\n3. The function enters a loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.\n4. In each iteration, the function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range.\n5. It compares the element at the midpoint index to the target element.\n   * If they are equal, the function returns the midpoint index.\n   * If the midpoint element is less than the target, the function updates `low` to `mid + 1`.\n   * If the midpoint element is greater than the target, the function updates `high` to `mid - 1`.\n6. If the loop ends without finding the target element, the function returns -1 to indicate that the element is not in the list.\n\n#### Time Complexity\n\nThe binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the sorted list. This makes it much more efficient than a linear search for large lists.",
