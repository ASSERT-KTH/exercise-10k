  "answer": "**Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) Demonstration in JavaScript**\n\nThe Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept in JavaScript that refers to the period between the start of a block scope and the initialization of a variable using `let` or `const`. During this period, the variable is not yet initialized, and attempting to access it will result in a `ReferenceError`.\n\n### Code\n\n```javascript\n// Demonstrate Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript\n\n// Example 1: Accessing a variable before its declaration\ntry {\n  console.log(x); // This will throw a ReferenceError\n  let x = 10;\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(\"Error:\", error.message);\n}\n\n// Example 2: Accessing a variable before its declaration in a block scope\ntry {\n  if (true) {\n    console.log(y); // This will throw a ReferenceError\n    let y = 20;\n  }\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(\"Error:\", error.message);\n}\n\n// Example 3: Variable is accessible after its declaration\nlet z = 30;\nconsole.log(z); // This will print 30\n\n// Example 4: Variable is not accessible in the TDZ\ntry {\n  if (true) {\n    console.log(w); // This will throw a ReferenceError\n    const w = 40;\n  }\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(\"Error:\", error.message);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn the provided code:\n\n1.  We demonstrate the TDZ by attempting to access variables `x`, `y`, and `w` before their declarations using `let` or `const`.\n2.  We use `try-catch` blocks to catch and log the `ReferenceError` that occurs when accessing variables in their TDZ.\n3.  We show that variables become accessible after their declarations, as seen with variable `z`.\n\nWhen you run this code, you will see `ReferenceError` messages for variables `x`, `y`, and `w`, indicating that they are in their TDZ. Variable `z` is accessible and prints its value, demonstrating that the TDZ ends after the variable's declaration.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the period between the start of a block scope and the initialization of a variable using `let` or `const`.\n*   Attempting to access a variable in its TDZ results in a `ReferenceError`.\n*   Variables become accessible after their declarations, marking the end of their TDZ.",
