  "answer": "**Finding the Missing Number in an Array**\n=====================================================\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution to find the missing number in an array of integers from 1 to n.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nGiven an array of integers from 1 to n, find the missing number.\n\n### Example\n\nInput: `[1, 2, 4, 5]`\nOutput: `3`\n\n### Solution\n\nWe can use the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to solve this problem. The formula is:\n\n`1 + 2 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2`\n\nWe can calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n using this formula, and then subtract the sum of the numbers in the array. The result will be the missing number.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in an array of integers from 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers from 1 to n with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums) + 1\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [1, 2, 4, 5]\nmissing_number = find_missing_number(nums)\nprint(missing_number)  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nWe can also use the XOR operation to solve this problem. The XOR operation has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. We can use this property to find the missing number.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number_xor(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in an array of integers from 1 to n using XOR.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers from 1 to n with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums) + 1\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result ^= i\n    for num in nums:\n        result ^= num\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [1, 2, 4, 5]\nmissing_number = find_missing_number_xor(nums)\nprint(missing_number)  # Output: 3\n```\n\nBoth of these solutions have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making them efficient for large inputs.",
