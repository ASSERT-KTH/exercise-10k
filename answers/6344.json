  "prompt": "Explain the concept of variable scope and provide examples of how it affects variable accessibility.",
  "answer": "Variable Scope\n===============\n\nVariable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is defined and accessible. It determines the visibility and accessibility of a variable, which means where the variable can be used and modified. Understanding variable scope is essential in programming, as it helps prevent errors, ensures code readability, and reduces the risk of data corruption.\n\nTypes of Variable Scope\n------------------------\n\nThere are several types of variable scope, including:\n\n1. **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside of any function or block have global scope, making them accessible from anywhere in the code.\n2. **Local Scope**: Variables defined within a function or block have local scope, making them accessible only within that function or block.\n3. **Block Scope**: Variables defined within a block (e.g., if, while, for) have block scope, making them accessible only within that block.\n4. **Function Scope**: Variables defined within a function have function scope, making them accessible only within that function.\n\nExamples of Variable Scope\n---------------------------\n\n### Example 1: Global Scope\n\n```python\nx = 10  # global variable\n\ndef my_function():\n    print(x)  # prints 10\n\nmy_function()\nprint(x)  # prints 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `x` is a global variable, making it accessible from anywhere in the code.\n\n### Example 2: Local Scope\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    y = 20  # local variable\n    print(y)  # prints 20\n\nmy_function()\nprint(y)  # raises NameError: name 'y' is not defined\n```\n\nIn this example, `y` is a local variable, making it accessible only within the `my_function` function. Trying to access `y` outside the function raises a `NameError`.\n\n### Example 3: Block Scope\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    z = i  # block variable\n    print(z)  # prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nprint(z)  # raises NameError: name 'z' is not defined\n```\n\nIn this example, `z` is a block variable, making it accessible only within the `for` loop. Trying to access `z` outside the loop raises a `NameError`.\n\n### Example 4: Function Scope with Nested Functions\n\n```python\ndef outer_function():\n    a = 30  # function variable\n\n    def inner_function():\n        print(a)  # prints 30\n\n    inner_function()\n    print(a)  # prints 30\n\nouter_function()\nprint(a)  # raises NameError: name 'a' is not defined\n```\n\nIn this example, `a` is a function variable, making it accessible within the `outer_function` and its nested `inner_function`. Trying to access `a` outside the `outer_function` raises a `NameError`.\n\nBest Practices for Variable Scope\n----------------------------------\n\nTo avoid errors and ensure code readability, follow these best practices:\n\n* Use meaningful variable names to avoid confusion.\n* Declare variables in the smallest scope possible to reduce the risk of data corruption.\n* Avoid using global variables whenever possible.\n* Use functions to encapsulate variables and reduce scope pollution.\n\nBy understanding variable scope and following best practices, you can write more efficient, readable, and maintainable code.",
