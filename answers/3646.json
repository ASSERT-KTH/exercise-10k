  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns 'Fizz' if the number is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if it is divisible by 5, and 'Fizz Buzz' if it is divisible by both",
  "answer": "### Fizz Buzz Function\n#### Description\nThe function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer as input and returns a string based on its divisibility by 3 and 5.\n\n#### Code\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns 'Fizz' if n is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if n is divisible by 5, \n    and 'Fizz Buzz' if n is divisible by both.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The Fizz Buzz result.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:\n        return 'Fizz Buzz'\n    elif n % 3 == 0:\n        return 'Fizz'\n    elif n % 5 == 0:\n        return 'Buzz'\n    else:\n        return str(n)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(fizz_buzz(15))  # Output: Fizz Buzz\n    print(fizz_buzz(3))   # Output: Fizz\n    print(fizz_buzz(5))   # Output: Buzz\n    print(fizz_buzz(4))   # Output: 4\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. The function checks if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.\n2. If not, it checks if the number is divisible by 3 or 5 separately.\n3. If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it returns the number as a string.\n\nThis solution uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check for divisibility. The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division of the number before it by the number after it. If the remainder is 0, the number is divisible by the divisor.",
