  "answer": "**Leap Year Checker Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes a year as input and prints out whether it is a leap year or not.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a year is a leap year.\n\n    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.\n\n    Args:\n        year (int): The year to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the year from the user\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n\n    # Check if the year is a leap year\n    if is_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a year that is a leap year (e.g. 2020): The program will print \"2020 is a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is not a leap year (e.g. 2021): The program will print \"2021 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is a century year (e.g. 1900): The program will print \"1900 is not a leap year.\"\n* Enter a year that is a century year and a leap year (e.g. 2000): The program will print \"2000 is a leap year.\"\n\n### How to Run\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `leap_year_checker.py`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python leap_year_checker.py` and pressing Enter.\n4. Follow the prompt to enter a year.",
