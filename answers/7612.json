  "prompt": "Create a program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a mathematical operation until they choose to exit.",
  "answer": "Here's an example program in Python that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nMathematical Operations Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Addition\")\n        print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n        print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n        print(\"4. Division\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an operation (1/2/3/4/5): \")\n\n        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n            if choice == '1':\n                print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n            elif choice == '2':\n                print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n            elif choice == '3':\n                print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n            elif choice == '4':\n                if num2 != 0:\n                    print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        elif choice == '5':\n            print(\"Exiting the program. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1.  The program enters a `while` loop that continues indefinitely until the user chooses to exit.\n2.  Inside the loop, it prints a menu with five options: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exit.\n3.  The user is asked to choose an operation by entering a number between 1 and 5.\n4.  If the user chooses an operation (1-4), they are prompted to enter two numbers.\n5.  Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding mathematical operation and displays the result.\n6.  If the user chooses division, the program checks if the second number is zero to prevent division by zero errors.\n7.  If the user chooses to exit (option 5), the program prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the `while` loop, ending the program.\n8.  If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.",
