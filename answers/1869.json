  "answer": "**Array Reduction Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program reduces an array to a single value using a reduction operation. The reduction operation is a function that takes two elements and returns a single element. In this case, we will use the sum, product, and average reduction operations.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef reduce_array(arr, operation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces an array to a single value using a reduction operation.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n        operation (str): The reduction operation to apply. Can be 'sum', 'product', or 'average'.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the reduction operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if operation == 'sum':\n        return np.sum(arr)\n    elif operation == 'product':\n        return np.prod(arr)\n    elif operation == 'average':\n        return np.mean(arr)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation. Must be 'sum', 'product', or 'average'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    operations = ['sum', 'product', 'average']\n\n    for operation in operations:\n        result = reduce_array(arr, operation)\n        print(f\"Result of {operation} operation: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `reduce_array` function takes an input array and a reduction operation as arguments.\n2. It applies the specified reduction operation to the array using NumPy functions.\n3. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `reduce_array` function with different reduction operations.\n4. The program prints the result of each reduction operation.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nResult of sum operation: 15\nResult of product operation: 120\nResult of average operation: 3.0\n```\n\nThis program showcases a simple and efficient way to reduce an array to a single value using different reduction operations.",
