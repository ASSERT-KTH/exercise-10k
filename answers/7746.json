  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's grade as input and prints out whether the student passed or failed. The passing grade is 50. If the grade is above 50, print 'Passed'. If the grade is 50 or below, print 'Failed'. Use conditional statements to solve this problem.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef check_grade():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks the user for their grade, then checks if it's a passing grade.\n    Prints 'Passed' if the grade is above 50, 'Failed' otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ask the user for their grade\n    grade = float(input(\"Enter your grade: \"))\n\n    # Check if the grade is above 50\n    if grade > 50:\n        print(\"Passed\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed\")\n\n# Call the function to start the program\ncheck_grade()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function called `check_grade()` that contains the program's logic.\n2. **User Input**: Inside the function, we use the built-in `input()` function to ask the user for their grade. The input is converted to a float to allow for decimal grades.\n3. **Conditional Statement**: We use an `if` statement to check if the grade is above 50. If it is, we print 'Passed'. Otherwise, we print 'Failed' using the `else` clause.\n4. **Function Call**: Finally, we call the `check_grade()` function to start the program.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* If the user enters `60`, the program will print `Passed`.\n* If the user enters `40`, the program will print `Failed`.\n* If the user enters `50`, the program will print `Failed`, since the passing grade is strictly above 50.",
