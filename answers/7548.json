  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a given range using a for loop or a while loop. The range is defined by a start and end value, and the program should be able to handle cases where the start value is greater than the end value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n# Purpose: Calculate the sum of all numbers in a given range\n\ndef calculate_sum(start, end):\n    if start > end:\n        start, end = end, start\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        sum += i\n    return sum\n\ndef calculate_sum_with_while(start, end):\n    if start > end:\n        start, end = end, start\n    sum = 0\n    while start <= end:\n        sum += start\n        start += 1\n    return sum\n\ndef main():\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the start of the range: \"))\n    end = int(input(\"Enter the end of the range: \"))\n    print(\"Sum using for loop:\", calculate_sum(start, end))\n    print(\"Sum using while loop:\", calculate_sum_with_while(start, end))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nNote that I've left out the author and date information, as it's not relevant to the code itself. You can fill in your own name and date if you like.",
