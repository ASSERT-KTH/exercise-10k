  "answer": "**Printing the First N Numbers in a Sequence using a For Loop**\n\nBelow is a Python program that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` numbers in a specific sequence. For this example, we'll use a simple arithmetic sequence where each term is the previous term plus a common difference `d`.\n\n```python\ndef print_sequence(n, d=1, start=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the first n numbers in an arithmetic sequence.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of terms to print.\n    d (int, optional): The common difference between terms. Defaults to 1.\n    start (int, optional): The starting term. Defaults to 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(n):\n        term = start + (i * d)\n        print(term)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms (n): \"))\n    d = int(input(\"Enter the common difference (d), default is 1: \") or 1)\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the starting term, default is 1: \") or 1)\n    print_sequence(n, d, start)\n```\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. The `print_sequence` function takes three parameters: `n` (the number of terms), `d` (the common difference), and `start` (the starting term).\n2. It uses a for loop to iterate `n` times.\n3. In each iteration, it calculates the current term using the formula `term = start + (i * d)`, where `i` is the current iteration index.\n4. It prints the calculated term.\n5. In the example usage section, the program prompts the user to input `n`, `d`, and `start`, and then calls the `print_sequence` function with these values.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nIf you input `n = 5`, `d = 2`, and `start = 3`, the program will print the first 5 terms of the arithmetic sequence starting with 3 and having a common difference of 2:\n\n```\n3\n5\n7\n9\n11\n```",
