  "answer": "**Calculator Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for a calculation until they choose to quit.\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Continuously asks the user for a calculation until they choose to quit.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nCalculator Menu:\")\n        print(\"1. Addition\")\n        print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n        print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n        print(\"4. Division\")\n        print(\"5. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an operation (1/2/3/4/5): \")\n\n        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n            if choice == '1':\n                print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n            elif choice == '2':\n                print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n            elif choice == '3':\n                print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n            elif choice == '4':\n                if num2 != 0:\n                    print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n        elif choice == '5':\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid choice. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Run the program and choose an operation from the menu.\n* Enter the two numbers for the operation.\n* The program will display the result of the operation.\n* To quit, choose the \"Quit\" option from the menu.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The program uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for input until they choose to quit.\n* The program handles invalid input and division by zero.\n* The program uses a simple menu-based system to allow the user to choose the operation they want to perform.",
