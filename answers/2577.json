  "answer": "Here's an example of a program that finds the maximum value in a 2D array using nested for loops in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_value(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the maximum value in a 2D array.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): A 2D list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    max_value (int): The maximum value in the 2D array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize max_value with the smallest possible integer value\n    max_value = float('-inf')\n\n    # Iterate over each row in the 2D array\n    for row in arr:\n        # Iterate over each element in the current row\n        for num in row:\n            # Check if the current number is greater than max_value\n            if num > max_value:\n                # Update max_value if a larger number is found\n                max_value = num\n\n    # Return the maximum value found in the 2D array\n    return max_value\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define a 2D array\n    array_2d = [\n        [1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]\n    ]\n\n    # Find and print the maximum value in the 2D array\n    max_value = find_max_value(array_2d)\n    print(\"Maximum value in the 2D array:\", max_value)\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The function `find_max_value` takes a 2D array `arr` as input and initializes `max_value` with the smallest possible integer value (`float('-inf')`).\n*   It iterates over each row in the 2D array using a nested for loop structure.\n*   Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current number `num` is greater than `max_value`. If it is, `max_value` is updated.\n*   After iterating over all elements in the 2D array, the function returns the maximum value found.\n*   In the example usage, a 2D array `array_2d` is defined, and the `find_max_value` function is called to find and print the maximum value in the array.\n\n**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is O(m \\* n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the 2D array. This is because the solution iterates over each element in the array once.\n\n**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1), excluding the space required for the input array, as the solution only uses a constant amount of space to store the maximum value.",
