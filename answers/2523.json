  "answer": "**Linear Search Algorithm Implementation**\n======================================\n\n### Overview\n\nLinear search is a simple algorithm used to find a specific element in a list of numbers. It works by iterating through the list and checking each element until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef linear_search(numbers, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for a specific element in a list of numbers using linear search.\n\n    Args:\n    - numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n    - target (int): The target element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n    - index (int): The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for index, num in enumerate(numbers):\n        if num == target:\n            return index\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7]\ntarget = 6\nresult = linear_search(numbers, target)\n\nif result != -1:\n    print(f\"Target element {target} found at index {result}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Target element {target} not found in the list.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `linear_search` function takes two arguments: `numbers` (a list of numbers) and `target` (the element to search for).\n2. The function iterates through the `numbers` list using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and value of each element.\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (`num`) matches the `target` element.\n4. If a match is found, the function returns the index of the target element.\n5. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not in the list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm checks each element once, resulting in a linear increase in time complexity as the list size grows.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of linear search is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the index and target element, regardless of the list size.",
