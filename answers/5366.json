  "answer": "**Filtering a List in Python**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python program that filters a list based on a condition.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list based on a condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The list to be filtered.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The filtered list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [item for item in input_list if condition(item)]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n    # Define a condition function\n    def is_even(num):\n        return num % 2 == 0\n\n    # Filter the list\n    even_numbers = filter_list(numbers, is_even)\n\n    print(\"Original List:\", numbers)\n    print(\"Filtered List:\", even_numbers)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `filter_list` function takes two arguments: `input_list` and `condition`.\n*   It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the items from `input_list` for which `condition` returns `True`.\n*   In the example usage, we define a list of numbers and a condition function `is_even` that checks if a number is even.\n*   We then call `filter_list` with the numbers list and the `is_even` condition, and print the original and filtered lists.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nFiltered List: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates how to filter a list based on a condition in Python. You can modify the condition function to filter the list based on different criteria.",
