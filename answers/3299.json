  "answer": "**Simon Says Game in Python**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Simon Says game is a classic children's game where one player, \"Simon,\" gives commands to the other players, but only if they start with \"Simon says.\" If Simon does not say \"Simon says,\" the players should not follow the command.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef simon_says_game():\n    \"\"\"\n    Play the Simon Says game with the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Welcome to the Simon Says game!\")\n    print(\"I will give you commands, and you have to follow them only if they start with 'Simon says.'\")\n    print(\"If I don't say 'Simon says,' you should not follow the command.\")\n    print(\"Let's start!\")\n\n    score = 0\n    while True:\n        # Generate a random command\n        commands = [\"jump\", \"clap\", \"dance\", \"run\", \"hop\"]\n        command = random.choice(commands)\n\n        # Randomly decide whether to say \"Simon says\"\n        simon_says = random.choice([True, False])\n\n        # Give the command to the user\n        if simon_says:\n            print(\"Simon says: \" + command)\n        else:\n            print(command)\n\n        # Get the user's response\n        response = input(\"What do you do? (type 'follow' to follow the command, or 'ignore' to ignore it): \")\n\n        # Check if the user's response is correct\n        if simon_says and response.lower() == \"follow\":\n            print(\"Correct! You followed the command.\")\n            score += 1\n        elif not simon_says and response.lower() == \"ignore\":\n            print(\"Correct! You ignored the command.\")\n            score += 1\n        elif simon_says and response.lower() == \"ignore\":\n            print(\"Incorrect! You should have followed the command.\")\n            break\n        elif not simon_says and response.lower() == \"follow\":\n            print(\"Incorrect! You should have ignored the command.\")\n            break\n\n        print(\"Your current score is: \" + str(score))\n\n    print(\"Game over! Your final score is: \" + str(score))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simon_says_game()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Read the instructions and start playing the game.\n3. When you see a command, type \"follow\" to follow it or \"ignore\" to ignore it.\n4. The game will continue until you make a mistake.\n5. Your final score will be displayed at the end of the game.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple while loop to keep the game running until the user makes a mistake. It generates random commands and decides whether to say \"Simon says\" or not. The user's responses are checked against the correct actions, and the game ends when the user makes an incorrect move.",
