  "prompt": "Create a program to calculate the force given the mass and acceleration.",
  "answer": "**Force Calculator Program**\n================================\n\nThis program calculates the force of an object given its mass and acceleration. The formula used is based on Newton's second law of motion: F = m * a, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef calculate_force(mass, acceleration):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the force of an object given its mass and acceleration.\n\n    Args:\n        mass (float): The mass of the object in kg.\n        acceleration (float): The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The force of the object in N.\n    \"\"\"\n    force = mass * acceleration\n    return force\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Force Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    mass = float(input(\"Enter the mass of the object in kg: \"))\n    acceleration = float(input(\"Enter the acceleration of the object in m/s^2: \"))\n\n    force = calculate_force(mass, acceleration)\n\n    print(f\"The force of the object is {force} N\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n-------------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter the mass of the object in kg (e.g., 10).\n3. Enter the acceleration of the object in m/s^2 (e.g., 5).\n4. The program will calculate and display the force of the object in N (e.g., 50 N).\n\n**How it Works**\n----------------\n\n1. The `calculate_force` function takes two arguments: `mass` and `acceleration`.\n2. It calculates the force using the formula F = m * a.\n3. The `main` function prompts the user to input the mass and acceleration.\n4. It calls the `calculate_force` function with the user-input values.\n5. It displays the calculated force to the user.",
