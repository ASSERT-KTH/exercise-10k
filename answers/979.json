  "prompt": "Given a dictionary, write a function to invert it, i.e., swap the keys and values. If the dictionary has non-unique values, the resulting dictionary should contain lists of keys that correspond to each value.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that inverts a dictionary by swapping its keys and values, handling cases with non-unique values. This function will return a new dictionary where each value from the original dictionary becomes a key, and its corresponding value is a list of keys from the original dictionary that mapped to it. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef invert_dict(input_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inverts a dictionary, swapping keys and values. If the dictionary has non-unique values, \n    the resulting dictionary will contain lists of keys that correspond to each value.\n\n    Args:\n        input_dict (dict): The dictionary to be inverted.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: The inverted dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the inverted result\n    inverted_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        # If the value is not already a key in the inverted dictionary, add it with the key as its value\n        if value not in inverted_dict:\n            # Since we don't know if the value will be unique or not, we'll start by storing the key as a list\n            inverted_dict[value] = [key]\n        else:\n            # If the value is already a key in the inverted dictionary, append the current key to its list of values\n            inverted_dict[value].append(key)\n\n    # Return the inverted dictionary\n    return inverted_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 3}\nprint(invert_dict(input_dict))  # Output: {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b'], 3: ['d']}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `invert_dict` initializes an empty dictionary `inverted_dict` to store the inverted result. It then iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `input_dict`.\n*   For each key-value pair, it checks if the value is not already a key in `inverted_dict`. If it's not, the value is added as a key with the original key as its value, stored in a list to handle potential non-unique values.\n*   If the value is already a key in `inverted_dict`, the current key is appended to its list of values.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `inverted_dict`, which contains the inverted key-value pairs from the original dictionary.",
