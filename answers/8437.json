  "prompt": "Create a program that takes in a day number and outputs the corresponding day of the week using conditional statements.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses conditional statements to determine the day of the week based on the day number:\n\n```python\ndef find_day(day_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a day number and returns the corresponding day of the week.\n\n    Parameters:\n    day_number (int): The day number (1-7) where 1 is Sunday and 7 is Saturday.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The day of the week corresponding to the input day number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the input day number is within the valid range (1-7)\n    if day_number < 1 or day_number > 7:\n        return \"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\"\n    \n    # Use conditional statements to determine the day of the week\n    if day_number == 1:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    elif day_number == 2:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif day_number == 3:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif day_number == 4:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif day_number == 5:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    elif day_number == 6:\n        return \"Friday\"\n    else:\n        return \"Saturday\"\n\n# Test the function\nprint(find_day(1))  # Sunday\nprint(find_day(2))  # Monday\nprint(find_day(3))  # Tuesday\nprint(find_day(4))  # Wednesday\nprint(find_day(5))  # Thursday\nprint(find_day(6))  # Friday\nprint(find_day(7))  # Saturday\nprint(find_day(8))  # Invalid day number\n```\n\nHowever, a more Pythonic way to solve this problem would be to use a list of days and index into it:\n\n```python\ndef find_day(day_number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a day number and returns the corresponding day of the week.\n\n    Parameters:\n    day_number (int): The day number (1-7) where 1 is Sunday and 7 is Saturday.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The day of the week corresponding to the input day number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define a list of days of the week\n    days = [\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\"]\n    \n    # Check if the input day number is within the valid range (1-7)\n    if day_number < 1 or day_number > 7:\n        return \"Invalid day number. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\"\n    \n    # Return the day of the week corresponding to the input day number\n    return days[day_number - 1]\n\n# Test the function\nprint(find_day(1))  # Sunday\nprint(find_day(2))  # Monday\nprint(find_day(3))  # Tuesday\nprint(find_day(4))  # Wednesday\nprint(find_day(5))  # Thursday\nprint(find_day(6))  # Friday\nprint(find_day(7))  # Saturday\nprint(find_day(8))  # Invalid day number\n```",
