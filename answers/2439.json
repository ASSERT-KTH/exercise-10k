  "answer": "**Tic Tac Toe Game in Python**\n=====================================\n\n### Game Description\n\nThis program simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe between a human player and the computer. The game uses a while loop to handle turns and a for loop to check for wins.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Initialize the game board\nboard = [' ' for _ in range(9)]\n\ndef print_board():\n    \"\"\"\n    Print the current state of the game board.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"{board[0]} | {board[1]} | {board[2]}\")\n    print(\"--+---+--\")\n    print(f\"{board[3]} | {board[4]} | {board[5]}\")\n    print(\"--+---+--\")\n    print(f\"{board[6]} | {board[7]} | {board[8]}\")\n\ndef check_win(player):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the given player has won the game.\n\n    Args:\n        player (str): The player to check for (either 'X' or 'O').\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the player has won, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]\n    for condition in win_conditions:\n        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] == player:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef computer_move():\n    \"\"\"\n    Make a random move for the computer player.\n    \"\"\"\n    available_moves = [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == ' ']\n    if available_moves:\n        move = random.choice(available_moves)\n        board[move] = 'O'\n\ndef main():\n    current_player = 'X'\n    while True:\n        print_board()\n        if current_player == 'X':\n            move = input(\"Enter your move (1-9): \")\n            if board[int(move) - 1] != ' ':\n                print(\"Invalid move, try again.\")\n                continue\n            board[int(move) - 1] = 'X'\n            if check_win('X'):\n                print_board()\n                print(\"You win!\")\n                break\n        else:\n            computer_move()\n            if check_win('O'):\n                print_board()\n                print(\"Computer wins!\")\n                break\n        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Play\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. The game board will be displayed.\n3. Enter your move by typing a number between 1 and 9, where 1 is the top left corner and 9 is the bottom right corner.\n4. The computer will make its move after your turn.\n5. The game will continue until either you or the computer wins.\n\nNote: This is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe and the computer player makes random moves. For a more challenging game, you could implement a more sophisticated AI algorithm.",
