  "answer": "Here is a Python program that finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximum difference between any two elements in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n\n    # Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list\n    min_num = min(numbers)\n    max_num = max(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate the maximum difference\n    max_diff = max_num - min_num\n\n    return max_diff\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nprint(\"Maximum difference:\", max_difference(numbers))\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `max_difference` that takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum numbers in the list, and then calculates the maximum difference by subtracting the minimum from the maximum. The function returns this maximum difference.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a list of numbers `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and pass it to the `max_difference` function. The function returns the maximum difference, which is `40` in this case.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function returns `0`. If you want to handle the case where the input list is empty differently, you can modify the function accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a more concise version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(numbers):\n    return max(numbers) - min(numbers) if numbers else 0\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses a conditional expression to return `0` if the input list is empty, and otherwise returns the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum numbers in the list.",
