The `analyze_text` function takes a string `text` as input and returns a dictionary containing the word count, character count, and average word length.\n2.  The function first removes leading and trailing whitespace from the text using the `strip` method.\n3.  It then calculates the character count by getting the length of the text.\n4.  The text is split into words using regular expressions. The `\\b\\w+\\b` pattern matches word boundaries and word characters.\n5.  The word count is calculated by getting the length of the list of words.\n6.  The average word length is calculated by summing the lengths of all words and dividing by the word count. If the word count is zero, the average word length is set to zero.\n7.  The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `analyze_text` function with an example text.\n8.  The program prints the text statistics, including the word count, character count, and average word length. The average word length is formatted to display two decimal places.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n*   Analyzing user input text for word count and character count.\n*   Calculating the average word length of a large corpus of text.\n*   Comparing the statistics of different texts to identify patterns or trends.\n\nNote: This program considers punctuation as part of a word. If you want to exclude punctuation, you can modify the regular expression pattern to `\\b\\w+\\b` to `\\b[a-zA-Z0-9]+\\b`.",
