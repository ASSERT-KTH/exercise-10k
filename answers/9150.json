  "answer": "### Extracting a Subset of Characters using Slicing\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to create a string variable and extract a subset of characters using slicing.\n\n```python\n# Create a string variable\nfull_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Extract a subset of characters using slicing\n# The slicing syntax is [start:stop:step]\n# Here, we're extracting from the 7th character to the 12th character\nsubset_string = full_string[7:12]\n\n# Print out the subset\nprint(\"Original String:\", full_string)\nprint(\"Subset of String:\", subset_string)\n```\n\n**How Slicing Works:**\n\n- `start`: The initial index of the slice. If omitted, it starts from the beginning.\n- `stop`: The ending index of the slice. If omitted, it goes until the end.\n- `step`: The increment between elements in the slice. If omitted, it is 1.\n\nIn this example, `full_string[7:12]` means start at the 7th character (index 7) and go up to but not including the 12th character (index 12). \n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal String: Hello, World!\nSubset of String: World\n```",
