  "answer": "**Dictionary Program**\n=======================\n\nBelow is a Python program that creates a dictionary of words and their meanings, allowing users to look up words and add new words to the dictionary.\n\n```python\nclass Dictionary:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.dictionary = {}\n\n    def add_word(self, word, meaning):\n        \"\"\"Add a new word to the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        self.dictionary[word.lower()] = meaning\n\n    def look_up_word(self, word):\n        \"\"\"Look up the meaning of a word in the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        return self.dictionary.get(word.lower(), \"Word not found in dictionary.\")\n\n    def display_dictionary(self):\n        \"\"\"Display all words and their meanings in the dictionary.\"\"\"\n        for word, meaning in self.dictionary.items():\n            print(f\"{word.capitalize()}: {meaning}\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    dictionary = Dictionary()\n\n    # Pre-populate the dictionary with some words\n    dictionary.add_word(\"hello\", \"a greeting\")\n    dictionary.add_word(\"world\", \"the earth and its inhabitants\")\n    dictionary.add_word(\"python\", \"a programming language\")\n\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\nDictionary Program\")\n        print(\"1. Look up a word\")\n        print(\"2. Add a new word\")\n        print(\"3. Display dictionary\")\n        print(\"4. Quit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n\n        if choice == \"1\":\n            word = input(\"Enter a word to look up: \")\n            print(f\"Meaning: {dictionary.look_up_word(word)}\")\n        elif choice == \"2\":\n            word = input(\"Enter a new word: \")\n            meaning = input(\"Enter the meaning of the word: \")\n            dictionary.add_word(word, meaning)\n            print(f\"Added '{word}' to the dictionary.\")\n        elif choice == \"3\":\n            print(\"\\nDictionary:\")\n            dictionary.display_dictionary()\n        elif choice == \"4\":\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid option. Please choose again.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Usage**\n---------------\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Choose option 1 to look up a word. Enter a word, such as \"hello\", and the program will display its meaning.\n3. Choose option 2 to add a new word. Enter a new word and its meaning, and the program will add it to the dictionary.\n4. Choose option 3 to display the entire dictionary.\n5. Choose option 4 to quit the program.\n\nNote: This program uses a simple dictionary to store words and their meanings. The dictionary is not persisted across runs of the program. If you want to persist the dictionary, you can modify the program to read and write to a file or database.",
