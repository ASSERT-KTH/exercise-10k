  "answer": "**Modulus Operator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of a division operation.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef find_remainder(dividend, divisor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the remainder of a division operation using the modulus operator.\n\n    Args:\n        dividend (int): The number being divided.\n        divisor (int): The number by which we are dividing.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The remainder of the division operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if divisor == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    remainder = dividend % divisor\n    return remainder\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    dividend = 17\n    divisor = 5\n    remainder = find_remainder(dividend, divisor)\n    print(f\"The remainder of {dividend} divided by {divisor} is {remainder}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `find_remainder` function takes two arguments: `dividend` and `divisor`.\n2. It checks if the `divisor` is zero to avoid a division by zero error.\n3. It calculates the remainder using the modulus operator (`%`).\n4. The `main` function demonstrates example usage of the `find_remainder` function.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThe remainder of 17 divided by 5 is 2\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of the division operation.\n* This program assumes that the dividend and divisor are integers.\n* If you need to perform floating-point division, you can modify the program accordingly.",
