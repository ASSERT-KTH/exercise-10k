  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns True if it is even and False otherwise.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that checks if a given number is even or not, providing a clear and step-by-step solution to your problem. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'is_even' that takes one argument 'num'.\ndef is_even(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a number is even.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to check if the input is an integer. If it's not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(num, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n\n    # Now, we use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of 'num' by 2.\n    # If the remainder is 0, then the number is even.\n    remainder = num % 2\n    \n    # We use a conditional statement to return True if the remainder is 0 and False otherwise.\n    # This is equivalent to saying: if the remainder is 0, return True; otherwise, return False.\n    return remainder == 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `is_even` takes an integer `num` as input and first checks if it's indeed an integer using `isinstance(num, int)`. If not, it raises a TypeError with a descriptive message.\n* It then calculates the remainder of `num` divided by 2 using the modulus operator `%` and stores this in the variable `remainder`.\n* The function uses a conditional statement `return remainder == 0` to return `True` if the number is even (i.e., `remainder` is 0) and `False` otherwise.\n* This approach ensures the function is concise, readable, and effectively determines whether a given number is even or odd.",
