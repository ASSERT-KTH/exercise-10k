  "answer": "Certainly! I'll help you create a function to find the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string. This function will enable you to locate the last instance of a specific substring within a given string. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_last_occurrence(main_string, sub_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        main_string (str): The main string to search in.\n        sub_string (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the last occurrence of the substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the substring is empty. If it is, we return 0 because an empty string is considered to be a substring of every string.\n    if not sub_string:\n        return 0\n\n    # Then, we use the rfind method of the string class in Python, which returns the highest index of the substring if it is found.\n    # If the substring is not found, it returns -1.\n    last_occurrence_index = main_string.rfind(sub_string)\n\n    # Finally, we return the index of the last occurrence of the substring.\n    return last_occurrence_index\n\n# Example usage:\nmain_str = \"Hello world, world is beautiful\"\nsub_str = \"world\"\nprint(find_last_occurrence(main_str, sub_str))  # Output: 12\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `find_last_occurrence` takes two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`. It first checks if `sub_string` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, as an empty string is considered a substring of every string.\n* The function utilizes the `rfind` method of the string class in Python, which returns the highest index of `sub_string` if it is found in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, `rfind` returns -1.\n* The `rfind` method is assigned to the variable `last_occurrence_index`, which is then returned by the function.\n* In the example usage, the function is called with `main_str` and `sub_str` as arguments, and it correctly returns the index of the last occurrence of `sub_str` in `main_str`.",
