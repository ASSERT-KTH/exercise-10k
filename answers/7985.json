  "answer": "**Prime Number Checker Program**\n=====================================\n\nBelow is a Python program that checks if a given number is a prime number.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    max_divisor = int(n**0.5) + 1\n    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):\n        if n % d == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    if is_prime(num):\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} is not a prime number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it's prime, `False` otherwise.\n2. The function first checks for edge cases:\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime.\n   - If `n` is 2, it's prime (the only even prime number).\n   - If `n` is divisible by 2 (i.e., it's even), it's not prime.\n3. The function then checks for divisibility up to the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than that would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n4. The `main` function asks the user to enter a number, checks if it's prime using the `is_prime` function, and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Input: `25` - Output: `25 is not a prime number.`\n* Input: `23` - Output: `23 is a prime number.`\n* Input: `37` - Output: `37 is a prime number.`\n\nTo run the program, save it to a file (e.g., `prime_checker.py`) and execute it using Python (e.g., `python prime_checker.py`). Follow the prompt to enter a number and see if it's prime.",
