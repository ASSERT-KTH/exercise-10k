  "answer": "Certainly! I'll provide you with a function to access a character at a specific index in a string, along with a clear explanation of how it works. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef access_char_at_index(string, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function accesses a character at a specific index in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        index (int): The index of the character to be accessed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The character at the specified index in the string.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input string is not of type 'str' or the index is not of type 'int'.\n        IndexError: If the index is out of range.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the input string is indeed a string and the index is an integer\n    if not isinstance(string, str) or not isinstance(index, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input string must be of type 'str' and index must be of type 'int'.\")\n\n    # Then, we check if the index is within the valid range for the given string\n    if index < 0 or index >= len(string):\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of range.\")\n\n    # Now, we can safely access the character at the specified index\n    # We use the built-in indexing feature of Python strings to do this\n    return string[index]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(access_char_at_index(\"Hello, World!\", 4))  # Outputs: 'o'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `access_char_at_index` takes two parameters: `string` and `index`. It first checks if the input `string` is indeed a string and the `index` is an integer, raising a `TypeError` if either condition is not met.\n* It then checks if the `index` is within the valid range for the given `string`, raising an `IndexError` if it's out of range.\n* If both checks pass, the function uses Python's built-in indexing feature to access the character at the specified `index` in the `string` and returns it.\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to access a character at a specific index in a string, printing the character at index 4 in the string \"Hello, World!\".",
