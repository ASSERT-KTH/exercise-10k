  "prompt": "Write a program that implements a Caesar Cipher, which shifts each letter in a string by a specified number of positions.",
  "answer": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements a Caesar Cipher, shifting each letter in the input string by the specified number of positions.\n\n    Parameters:\n    text (str): The input string to be encrypted.\n    shift (int): The number of positions to shift each letter.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The encrypted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for char in text:\n        # Check if the character is an uppercase letter\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + shift) % 26 + ord('A'))\n        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Find the position in the alphabet for the character and add the shift\n            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))\n        # If the character is not a letter, add it to the result as is\n        else:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    text = \"Hello, World!\"\n    shift = 3\n    encrypted_text = caesar_cipher(text, shift)\n    print(f\"Text: {text}\")\n    print(f\"Shift: {shift}\")\n    print(f\"Encrypted Text: {encrypted_text}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The `caesar_cipher` function takes two parameters: `text` (the input string) and `shift` (the number of positions to shift each letter).\n*   It iterates over each character in the input string.\n*   If the character is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase), it calculates the new character by shifting the current character by the specified number of positions. The `ord` function returns the ASCII value of a character, and `chr` returns the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n*   The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., shifting 'z' by 1 results in 'a').\n*   Non-alphabet characters (such as punctuation and spaces) are added to the result as is, without any modification.\n*   The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `caesar_cipher` function with an example text and shift value.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function iterates over each character in the string once.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function creates a new string to store the encrypted result, which has the same length as the input string.",
