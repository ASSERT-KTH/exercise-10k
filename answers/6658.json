  "answer": "Here is a Python solution to generate an arithmetic progression sequence up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, max_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an arithmetic progression sequence up to a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (int): The first term of the sequence.\n        common_difference (int): The common difference between each term.\n        max_value (int): The maximum value up to which the sequence should be generated.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The generated arithmetic progression sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [first_term]\n    next_term = first_term + common_difference\n\n    while next_term <= max_value:\n        sequence.append(next_term)\n        next_term += common_difference\n\n    return sequence\n\n\n# Example usage:\nfirst_term = 2\ncommon_difference = 3\nmax_value = 20\n\nsequence = generate_arithmetic_progression(first_term, common_difference, max_value)\nprint(\"Arithmetic Progression Sequence:\", sequence)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function `generate_arithmetic_progression` that takes the first term, common difference, and maximum value as arguments.\n*   We initialize the sequence with the first term and calculate the next term by adding the common difference to the first term.\n*   We use a while loop to generate the sequence up to the maximum value, appending each new term to the sequence and updating the next term.\n*   Finally, we return the generated sequence.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example values (first term = 2, common difference = 3, max value = 20), it will output the arithmetic progression sequence up to 20.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nArithmetic Progression Sequence: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20]\n```",
