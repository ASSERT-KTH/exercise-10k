  "prompt": "Create a function that takes a dictionary and a key as arguments and returns the corresponding value.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that retrieves a value from a dictionary based on a given key, handling potential errors and edge cases. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef get_dict_value(dictionary, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retrieves the value associated with a given key from a dictionary.\n\n    Args:\n        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search in.\n        key: The key to search for in the dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        The value associated with the key if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if the dictionary is actually a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):\n        raise TypeError(\"The first argument must be a dictionary.\")\n\n    # Then, we try to get the value from the dictionary\n    # The get method of a dictionary returns None if the key is not found\n    # This is a safer approach than directly accessing the key with dictionary[key]\n    # Because that would raise a KeyError if the key is not found\n    value = dictionary.get(key)\n    \n    # Finally, we return the value\n    return value\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"name\"))  # Outputs: John\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"age\"))   # Outputs: 30\nprint(get_dict_value(my_dict, \"city\"))  # Outputs: None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `get_dict_value` takes two arguments, `dictionary` and `key`, and first checks if the provided `dictionary` is indeed a dictionary using `isinstance`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It uses the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the value associated with the given `key`. This approach is safer than directly accessing the key with `dictionary[key]` because it returns `None` if the key is not found, avoiding a potential `KeyError`.\n* The function returns the retrieved value, which can be `None` if the key is not present in the dictionary.\n* Example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample dictionary `my_dict`, retrieving values for existing keys (`name` and `age`) and a non-existent key (`city`), showcasing the function's behavior in different scenarios.",
