  "prompt": "Create a program that checks if a student has passed or failed based on their grade. The program should take the grade as input and output 'Passed' if the grade is 50 or above, and 'Failed' otherwise.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the specifications:\n```\n# Grade Checker\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\ndef check_grade(grade):\n    if grade >= 50:\n        return 'Passed'\n    else:\n        return 'Failed'\n\nresult = check_grade(60)\nprint(result)\n```\nNote: I've left the author and date fields blank, as they would typically be filled in by the person writing the code. You can replace them with your own name and the current date if you like.",
