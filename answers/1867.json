  "prompt": "Write a program to search for an element in an array and print its index if found.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that performs this task:\n\n```python\ndef search_element(array, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for an element in the given array and returns its index if found.\n\n    Args:\n        array (list): The list to search in.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use the index method to find the index of the target element\n        index = array.index(target)\n        return index\n    except ValueError:\n        # If the target element is not found, return -1\n        return -1\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    target = 5\n\n    index = search_element(array, target)\n\n    if index != -1:\n        print(f\"Element {target} found at index {index}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Element {target} not found in the array.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The `search_element` function takes in an array and a target element as arguments.\n2. It attempts to find the index of the target element using the `index` method. If the target element is found, its index is returned.\n3. If the target element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised. This exception is caught and handled by returning -1 to indicate that the target element was not found.\n4. In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `search_element` function with an example array and target element. We then print out the result, indicating whether the target element was found and its index if applicable.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n* The time complexity of the `search_element` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the `index` method scans the array from left to right until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the array.\n* The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the index and target element.",
