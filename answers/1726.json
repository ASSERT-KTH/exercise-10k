  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list of numbers and a target value as input, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target value if it exists in the list.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that matches the provided specification:\n```\ndef find_first_occurrence(nums, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the list.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): The list of numbers to search.\n        target (int): The target value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the first occurrence of the target value, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ntarget = 5\nresult = find_first_occurrence(nums, target)\nprint(result)  # Output: 4\n\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ntarget = 10\nresult = find_first_occurrence(nums, target)\nprint(result)  # Output: -1\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
