  "answer": "**Geometric Sequence Generator Program**\n=====================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program generates a geometric sequence given the first term, common ratio, and number of terms. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_geometric_sequence(first_term, common_ratio, num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a geometric sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        first_term (float): The first term of the sequence.\n        common_ratio (float): The common ratio of the sequence.\n        num_terms (int): The number of terms in the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of numbers representing the geometric sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [first_term]\n    for _ in range(1, num_terms):\n        next_term = sequence[-1] * common_ratio\n        sequence.append(next_term)\n    return sequence\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    first_term = float(input(\"Enter the first term: \"))\n    common_ratio = float(input(\"Enter the common ratio: \"))\n    num_terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms: \"))\n\n    sequence = generate_geometric_sequence(first_term, common_ratio, num_terms)\n    print(\"Geometric Sequence:\")\n    for i, term in enumerate(sequence):\n        print(f\"Term {i+1}: {term}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `generate_geometric_sequence` function takes three arguments: `first_term`, `common_ratio`, and `num_terms`.\n2. It initializes a list `sequence` with the `first_term`.\n3. It then uses a loop to generate the remaining terms of the sequence by multiplying the previous term by the `common_ratio`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user for input, calls the `generate_geometric_sequence` function, and prints the resulting sequence.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo generate a geometric sequence with a first term of 2, a common ratio of 3, and 5 terms, run the program and enter the following inputs:\n\n* First term: 2\n* Common ratio: 3\n* Number of terms: 5\n\nThe program will output the following geometric sequence:\n\nGeometric Sequence:\nTerm 1: 2.0\nTerm 2: 6.0\nTerm 3: 18.0\nTerm 4: 54.0\nTerm 5: 162.0",
