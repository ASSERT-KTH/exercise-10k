  "prompt": "Implement the depth-first search algorithm to traverse a graph. The program should take a graph represented as an adjacency list and a starting node as input and output the order of visited nodes.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a graph represented as an adjacency list. The code defines a function `dfs` that takes a graph and a starting node as input, and returns the order of visited nodes.\n\n```python\ndef dfs(graph, start):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a depth-first search on a graph.\n\n    Args:\n    graph: A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph.\n    start: The node to start the search from.\n\n    Returns:\n    A list of nodes in the order they were visited.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a set to store visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Create a list to store the order of visited nodes\n    traversal_order = []\n    \n    # Define a helper function to perform the recursive DFS\n    def dfs_helper(node):\n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(node)\n        \n        # Add the current node to the traversal order\n        traversal_order.append(node)\n        \n        # Iterate over the neighbors of the current node\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            # If the neighbor has not been visited, recursively visit it\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                dfs_helper(neighbor)\n    \n    # Start the DFS from the given starting node\n    dfs_helper(start)\n    \n    # Return the traversal order\n    return traversal_order\n\n# Example usage\ngraph = {\n    'A': ['B', 'C'],\n    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n    'C': ['A', 'F'],\n    'D': ['B'],\n    'E': ['B', 'F'],\n    'F': ['C', 'E']\n}\n\nstart_node = 'A'\n\ntraversal_order = dfs(graph, start_node)\n\nprint(\"Depth-first traversal order:\", traversal_order)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `dfs` that takes a graph represented as an adjacency list and a starting node as input. It performs a depth-first search on the graph using a recursive helper function `dfs_helper`. The `dfs_helper` function marks the current node as visited, adds it to the traversal order, and recursively visits its unvisited neighbors. The `dfs` function starts the DFS from the given starting node and returns the traversal order. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `dfs` function to perform a DFS on a sample graph.",
