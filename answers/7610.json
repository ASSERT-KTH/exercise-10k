  "answer": "**Identity Operators Program**\n================================\n\nThis program demonstrates the use of identity operators (`is` and `is not`) to check if two variables are the same object in Python.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```python\n# Define two lists\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Define two variables referencing the same list\nlist3 = list1\nlist4 = list1\n\ndef main():\n    # Check if list1 and list2 are the same object\n    print(\"Are list1 and list2 the same object? \", list1 is list2)\n    \n    # Check if list1 and list3 are the same object\n    print(\"Are list1 and list3 the same object? \", list1 is list3)\n    \n    # Check if list1 and list4 are the same object\n    print(\"Are list1 and list4 the same object? \", list1 is list4)\n    \n    # Check if list1 is not the same object as list2\n    print(\"Is list1 not the same object as list2? \", list1 is not list2)\n    \n    # Check if list1 is not the same object as list3\n    print(\"Is list1 not the same object as list3? \", list1 is not list3)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Output**\n------------\n\n```\nAre list1 and list2 the same object?  False\nAre list1 and list3 the same object?  True\nAre list1 and list4 the same object?  True\nIs list1 not the same object as list2?  True\nIs list1 not the same object as list3?  False\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   We define two lists `list1` and `list2` with the same elements, but they are separate objects in memory.\n*   We define two variables `list3` and `list4` that reference the same list as `list1`.\n*   In the `main` function, we use the `is` operator to check if `list1` and `list2` are the same object (they are not).\n*   We then check if `list1` and `list3` (or `list4`) are the same object (they are, because `list3` and `list4` reference the same list as `list1`).\n*   Finally, we use the `is not` operator to check if `list1` is not the same object as `list2` (it is not), and if `list1` is not the same object as `list3` (it is not, because they are the same object).",
