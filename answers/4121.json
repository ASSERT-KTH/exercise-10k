  "answer": "### Variable Declaration and Printing Student Information\n\nBelow is a Python code snippet that declares variables for a student's name and age, then prints out the student's information.\n\n```python\n# Declare variables\nstudent_name = \"John Doe\"\nstudent_age = 20\n\n# Print student information\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_name)\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_age)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\nStudent Name: John Doe\nStudent Age: 20\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach Using a Dictionary\n\nIf you want to store more information about the student, you can use a dictionary for better organization.\n\n```python\n# Declare a dictionary to store student information\nstudent_info = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 20\n}\n\n# Print student information\nprint(\"Student Name:\", student_info[\"name\"])\nprint(\"Student Age:\", student_info[\"age\"])\n```\n\nBoth code snippets achieve the same goal, but the dictionary approach is more flexible and scalable for storing additional student details.",
