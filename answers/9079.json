  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number within a given range using if statements",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that uses if statements to validate the input range and then generates a random number within that range.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_random_number():\n    # Get the lower and upper bounds from the user\n    lower_bound = input(\"Enter the lower bound: \")\n    upper_bound = input(\"Enter the upper bound: \")\n\n    # Validate the input\n    if lower_bound.isdigit() and upper_bound.isdigit():\n        lower_bound = int(lower_bound)\n        upper_bound = int(upper_bound)\n\n        # Ensure the lower bound is less than the upper bound\n        if lower_bound < upper_bound:\n            random_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            print(f\"A random number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound} is: {random_number}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The lower bound must be less than the upper bound.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Please enter valid numbers for the bounds.\")\n\n# Call the function\ngenerate_random_number()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis program does the following:\n1. Asks the user to input the lower and upper bounds for the random number range.\n2. Checks if the input is a digit using the `isdigit()` method.\n3. Converts the input to integers using `int()`.\n4. Ensures the lower bound is less than the upper bound using an if statement.\n5. Generates a random number within the given range using `random.randint()`.\n6. Prints the generated random number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- Run the program and enter `1` as the lower bound and `10` as the upper bound. The program should print a random number between 1 and 10.\n- Run the program and enter `10` as the lower bound and `1` as the upper bound. The program should print an error message because the lower bound is not less than the upper bound.\n- Run the program and enter `a` as the lower bound and `b` as the upper bound. The program should print an error message because the input is not valid numbers.",
