  "answer": "**Image Processing Program**\n==========================\n\nThis program takes an image file as input and applies basic image processing operations like resizing and cropping.\n\n**Requirements**\n---------------\n\n* Python 3.x\n* Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)\n\n**Code**\n------\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\ndef resize_image(image_path, output_path, size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Resize an image to a specified size.\n\n    Args:\n        image_path (str): Path to the input image file.\n        output_path (str): Path to the output image file.\n        size (tuple): New size of the image (width, height).\n    \"\"\"\n    image = Image.open(image_path)\n    image = image.resize(size)\n    image.save(output_path)\n\ndef crop_image(image_path, output_path, box):\n    \"\"\"\n    Crop an image to a specified region.\n\n    Args:\n        image_path (str): Path to the input image file.\n        output_path (str): Path to the output image file.\n        box (tuple): Region to crop (left, upper, right, lower).\n    \"\"\"\n    image = Image.open(image_path)\n    image = image.crop(box)\n    image.save(output_path)\n\ndef main():\n    image_path = input(\"Enter the path to the input image file: \")\n    output_path = input(\"Enter the path to the output image file: \")\n\n    print(\"Choose an operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Resize\")\n    print(\"2. Crop\")\n    operation = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2): \")\n\n    if operation == \"1\":\n        width = int(input(\"Enter the new width: \"))\n        height = int(input(\"Enter the new height: \"))\n        resize_image(image_path, output_path, (width, height))\n    elif operation == \"2\":\n        left = int(input(\"Enter the left coordinate: \"))\n        upper = int(input(\"Enter the upper coordinate: \"))\n        right = int(input(\"Enter the right coordinate: \"))\n        lower = int(input(\"Enter the lower coordinate: \"))\n        crop_image(image_path, output_path, (left, upper, right, lower))\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n**Usage**\n-----\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `image_processing.py`.\n2. Install the Pillow library by running `pip install pillow` in your terminal.\n3. Run the program by executing `python image_processing.py` in your terminal.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the input image file path, output image file path, and operation choice.\n5. For resizing, enter the new width and height. For cropping, enter the coordinates of the region to crop.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n* Resizing an image:\n\t+ Input image file: `input.jpg`\n\t+ Output image file: `output.jpg`\n\t+ New size: `(800, 600)`\n* Cropping an image:\n\t+ Input image file: `input.jpg`\n\t+ Output image file: `output.jpg`\n\t+ Region to crop: `(100, 100, 300, 300)`\n\nNote: Make sure to replace the `input.jpg` and `output.jpg` files with your actual image files.",
