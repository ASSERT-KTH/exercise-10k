  "prompt": "Write a program to print the following pattern using loops: for a given number n, print a pattern of asterisks (*) where each row has one more asterisk than the previous row, and the total number of rows is n. For example, if n = 4, the pattern should be: \n* \n** \n*** \n****",
  "answer": "Here is a Python program to print the pattern:\n\n```python\ndef print_asterisk_pattern(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a pattern of asterisks (*) where each row has one more asterisk than the previous row,\n    and the total number of rows is n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of rows in the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(\"*\" * i)\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 4\nprint(f\"Pattern for n = {n}:\")\nprint_asterisk_pattern(n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We define a function `print_asterisk_pattern(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n3. In each iteration, we print a string of asterisks (`*`) repeated `i` times, where `i` is the current iteration number.\n4. We use the expression `\"*\" * i` to create a string of `i` asterisks. This works because in Python, you can repeat a string by multiplying it with an integer.\n5. Finally, we call the function with an example value of `n = 4` and print the resulting pattern.\n\nOutput:\n```\nPattern for n = 4:\n* \n** \n*** \n**** \n```\n\nNote: This program uses a simple `for` loop to print the pattern, making it efficient and easy to understand. The `print()` function is used to print the asterisks, and the `*` operator is used to repeat the asterisk character.",
