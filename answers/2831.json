  "answer": "**Password Strength Checker Program**\n\n### Overview\nThis program checks the strength of a given password based on the following criteria:\n* Password length is above 8 characters\n* Password contains at least one uppercase letter\n* Password contains at least one lowercase letter\n* Password contains at least one digit\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef check_password_strength(password):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the strength of a given password.\n\n    Args:\n        password (str): The password to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the password is strong, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check password length\n    if len(password) <= 8:\n        return False\n\n    # Check for uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and digit\n    if not re.search(\"[A-Z]\", password):\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[a-z]\", password):\n        return False\n    if not re.search(\"[0-9]\", password):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    password = input(\"Enter a password: \")\n    if check_password_strength(password):\n        print(\"Password is strong.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Password is weak. Please ensure it meets the following criteria:\")\n        print(\"* Length is above 8 characters\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one uppercase letter\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one lowercase letter\")\n        print(\"* Contains at least one digit\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `check_password_strength` function checks the length of the password and returns False if it's 8 characters or less.\n2. It then uses regular expressions to search for at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit in the password. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns False.\n3. If all conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating a strong password.\n4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a password, which is then passed to the `check_password_strength` function.\n5. Based on the result, a message is printed indicating whether the password is strong or weak, along with the criteria for a strong password.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Enter a strong password: `P@ssw0rd123`\n* Enter a weak password: `password`\n* Enter a password with insufficient length: `P@1`",
