  "prompt": "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100:\n\n```python\n# Import the random module\nimport random\n\n# Use the randint function to generate a random number between 1 and 100\nrandom_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n\n# Print the random number\nprint(random_number)\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n*   We import the `random` module, which provides functionality for generating random numbers.\n*   We use the `randint(a, b)` function to generate a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`. In this case, `a` is 1 and `b` is 100.\n*   Finally, we print the generated random number.\n\nTo run this program, save it in a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `random_number.py`) and run it using a Python interpreter. The output will be a random number between 1 and 100.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n53\n```\n\nEach time you run the program, you'll get a different random number between 1 and 100.\n\nIf you want to generate multiple random numbers, you can use a loop:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nfor _ in range(10):\n    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    print(random_number)\n```\n\nThis will generate and print 10 random numbers between 1 and 100.",
