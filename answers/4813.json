  "prompt": "Given an array of integers where each element appears twice except for one, find the single number. The function should take in an array of integers as input and return the single number.",
  "answer": "Here's the Python code based on your specifications:\n\n```python\ndef singleNumber(nums):\n    res = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        res ^= num\n    return res\n\n# Test cases\nprint(singleNumber([2, 2, 1]))  # Expected output: 1\nprint(singleNumber([4, 1, 2, 1, 2]))  # Expected output: 4\nprint(singleNumber([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: 3\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We define a function called `singleNumber` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n*   We initialize a variable `res` to 0. This variable will hold the result of the XOR operation performed on all numbers in the input list.\n*   We iterate over each number `num` in the input list `nums`.\n*   Inside the loop, we perform the XOR operation between `res` and `num`. This operation is done using the `^` operator, which returns 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.\n*   After the loop finishes, `res` will hold the single number that appears only once in the input list. We return this value as the result of the function.\n*   We then test the function with three test cases to verify its correctness.",
