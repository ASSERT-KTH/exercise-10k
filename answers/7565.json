  "answer": "**Function Decorator Example**\n================================\n\nBelow is an example of a Python function that uses a decorator to modify its behavior. In this case, the decorator is used to measure the execution time of the function.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\n# Define a decorator function\ndef timer_decorator(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    A decorator function that measures the execution time of a given function.\n    \n    Args:\n        func: The function to be decorated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        A wrapper function that includes the execution time measurement.\n    \"\"\"\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Record the start time\n        start_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Call the original function\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # Record the end time\n        end_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Calculate the execution time\n        execution_time = end_time - start_time\n        \n        # Print the execution time\n        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' executed in {execution_time:.4f} seconds.\")\n        \n        # Return the result of the original function\n        return result\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n# Apply the decorator to a function\n@timer_decorator\ndef example_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    An example function that simulates some work.\n    \"\"\"\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work\n    print(\"Example function executed.\")\n\n# Test the decorated function\ndef main():\n    example_function()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works**\n---------------\n\n1.  The `timer_decorator` function is defined to take another function (`func`) as an argument.\n2.  Inside `timer_decorator`, a new function (`wrapper`) is defined to wrap around the original function (`func`).\n3.  The `wrapper` function records the start time, calls the original function, records the end time, calculates the execution time, and prints it.\n4.  The `@wraps(func)` decorator is used to preserve the original function's metadata (e.g., name, docstring).\n5.  The `timer_decorator` is applied to the `example_function` using the `@timer_decorator` syntax.\n6.  When `example_function` is called, it will execute the original function and also print the execution time due to the decorator.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nExample function executed.\nFunction 'example_function' executed in 1.0011 seconds.\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how a decorator can be used to add additional functionality (in this case, execution time measurement) to a function without modifying its original code.",
