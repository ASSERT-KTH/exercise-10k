  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a student's score as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following conditions: score >= 90 (A), score >= 80 (B), score >= 70 (C), score >= 60 (D), score < 60 (F). The program should handle invalid scores and print an error message if the score is not between 0 and 100.",
  "answer": "Here's the code in Python:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grade(score):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the grade based on the given score.\n\n    Args:\n        score (int): The score of the student.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The corresponding grade.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100)\n    if not 0 <= score <= 100:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid score. Score should be between 0 and 100.\")\n        return None\n\n    # Check the conditions for each grade and return the corresponding grade\n    if score >= 90:\n        # If the score is 90 or above, the grade is A\n        return \"A\"\n    elif score >= 80:\n        # If the score is 80 or above, the grade is B\n        return \"B\"\n    elif score >= 70:\n        # If the score is 70 or above, the grade is C\n        return \"C\"\n    elif score >= 60:\n        # If the score is 60 or above, the grade is D\n        return \"D\"\n    else:\n        # If the score is below 60, the grade is F\n        return \"F\"\n\n# Example usage:\nscore = 85\ngrade = calculate_grade(score)\nif grade is not None:\n    print(f\"The grade for a score of {score} is {grade}.\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1.  We define a function `calculate_grade` that takes a `score` as input and returns the corresponding grade.\n2.  We first check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100). If not, we print an error message and return `None`.\n3.  We then use conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score. We check the conditions in descending order (from highest to lowest) to ensure that the correct grade is assigned.\n4.  Finally, we provide an example usage of the function, where we calculate the grade for a score of 85 and print the result.",
