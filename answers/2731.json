  "answer": "**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator**\n============================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The GCD of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    num1 = 48\n    num2 = 18\n    gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)\n    print(f\"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gcd` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The function uses a while loop to apply the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is zero.\n3. At this point, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `calculate_gcd` function with an example.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the GCD of 48 and 18: `calculate_gcd(48, 18)` returns `6`\n* Calculate the GCD of 24 and 30: `calculate_gcd(24, 30)` returns `6`\n\n### Advice\n\n* This implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and easy to understand.\n* The function is designed to handle positive integers. If you need to handle negative integers or zero, you may need to modify the function accordingly.",
