  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates the compound interest given the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years. It uses the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n* A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest\n* P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money)\n* r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n* n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n* t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years, compounding_frequency=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n    - principal (float): The principal amount.\n    - interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal form).\n    - years (int): The number of years.\n    - compounding_frequency (int): The number of times that interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The amount of money accumulated after the specified number of years, including interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate / compounding_frequency) ** (compounding_frequency * years)\n    return amount\n\ndef main():\n    principal = float(input(\"Enter the principal amount: \"))\n    interest_rate = float(input(\"Enter the annual interest rate (in percent): \")) / 100\n    years = int(input(\"Enter the number of years: \"))\n    compounding_frequency = int(input(\"Enter the compounding frequency (e.g., 1 for annually, 12 for monthly): \"))\n\n    amount = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years, compounding_frequency)\n    interest = amount - principal\n\n    print(f\"Principal Amount: ${principal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Rate: {interest_rate * 100:.2f}%\")\n    print(f\"Number of Years: {years}\")\n    print(f\"Compounding Frequency: {compounding_frequency} times per year\")\n    print(f\"Total Amount: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Interest Earned: ${interest:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo use this program, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the principal amount, interest rate, number of years, and compounding frequency. The program will then calculate and display the total amount and interest earned.\n\nFor example, if you enter:\n\n* Principal Amount: 1000\n* Interest Rate: 5\n* Number of Years: 5\n* Compounding Frequency: 1\n\nThe program will output:\n\n* Principal Amount: $1000.00\n* Interest Rate: 5.00%\n* Number of Years: 5\n* Compounding Frequency: 1 times per year\n* Total Amount: $1276.28\n* Interest Earned: $276.28",
