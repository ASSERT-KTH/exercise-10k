  "answer": "### Bitwise Operator Expression\n\nHere's an example of an expression using bitwise operators in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\na = 5   # Binary: 101\nb = 3   # Binary: 011\n\n# Perform bitwise operations\nresult_and = a & b  # Binary AND: 101 & 011 = 001\nresult_or = a | b   # Binary OR: 101 | 011 = 111\nresult_xor = a ^ b  # Binary XOR: 101 ^ 011 = 110\nresult_shift_left = a << 1  # Binary left shift: 101 << 1 = 1010\nresult_shift_right = a >> 1  # Binary right shift: 101 >> 1 = 10\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Bitwise AND:\", result_and)\nprint(\"Bitwise OR:\", result_or)\nprint(\"Bitwise XOR:\", result_xor)\nprint(\"Left Shift:\", result_shift_left)\nprint(\"Right Shift:\", result_shift_right)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will perform the specified bitwise operations on the variables `a` and `b` and print out the results.\n\n### Explanation of Bitwise Operators\n\n- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are not the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The left shift operator essentially multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.\n- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The right shift operator essentially divides the number by 2 for each shift.",
