  "prompt": "Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere as input and returns its volume.",
  "answer": "Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a program that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. This program will utilize a mathematical formula to compute the volume. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_sphere_volume(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    radius (float): The radius of the sphere.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The volume of the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # First, we need to check if the input is a non-negative number, \n    # because the radius cannot be negative.\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The radius cannot be negative.\")\n    \n    # The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3, \n    # where r is the radius of the sphere.\n    # We use the math.pi constant from the math module for \u03c0.\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    \n    # Finally, we return the calculated volume.\n    return volume\n\n# Test the function with a radius of 5.\nprint(calculate_sphere_volume(5))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `calculate_sphere_volume` takes one parameter, `radius`, which is the radius of the sphere. It first checks if the `radius` is less than 0, raising a `ValueError` if true because a sphere's radius cannot be negative.\n* The volume of the sphere is calculated using the formula `(4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3`, where `r` is the radius. The `math.pi` constant from the `math` module is used for \u03c0.\n* The calculated volume is then returned by the function.\n* To test the function, it is called with a `radius` of 5, and the result is printed to the console.",
