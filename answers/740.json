  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a number and a percentage as input and outputs the result of the percentage calculation.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates a percentage of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_percentage(number, percentage):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a percentage of a given number.\n\n    Args:\n        number (float): The number to calculate the percentage of.\n        percentage (float): The percentage to calculate.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The result of the percentage calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the percentage\n    result = (percentage / 100) * number\n    \n    return result\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the number and percentage from the user\n    number = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n    percentage = float(input(\"Enter a percentage: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and display the result\n    result = calculate_percentage(number, percentage)\n    print(f\"{percentage}% of {number} is {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate 20% of 100: Enter `100` as the number and `20` as the percentage. The program will output `20.0`.\n* Calculate 50% of 200: Enter `200` as the number and `50` as the percentage. The program will output `100.0`.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. The `calculate_percentage` function takes two arguments: `number` and `percentage`.\n2. It calculates the percentage by dividing the `percentage` by 100 and multiplying the result by the `number`.\n3. The `main` function gets the `number` and `percentage` from the user using the `input` function.\n4. It calls the `calculate_percentage` function with the user's input and displays the result.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Make sure to enter valid numbers and percentages when using the program.\n* You can modify the program to accept different types of input, such as a list of numbers or a range of percentages.\n* You can also add error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input.",
