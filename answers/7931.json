  "answer": "**Currency Converter Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes in an amount of money and an exchange rate as input, and outputs the equivalent amount in the other currency.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate, from_currency, to_currency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a given amount of money from one currency to another.\n\n    Args:\n        amount (float): The amount of money to convert.\n        exchange_rate (float): The exchange rate between the two currencies.\n        from_currency (str): The currency of the input amount.\n        to_currency (str): The currency to convert to.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The equivalent amount in the target currency.\n    \"\"\"\n    converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate\n    return converted_amount\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Currency Converter Program\")\n    print(\"---------------------------\")\n\n    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount of money to convert: \"))\n    exchange_rate = float(input(\"Enter the exchange rate (1 {} = ? {}): \".format(\"USD\", \"EUR\")))\n    from_currency = \"USD\"\n    to_currency = \"EUR\"\n\n    converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, exchange_rate, from_currency, to_currency)\n\n    print(\"{} {} is equivalent to {} {}\".format(amount, from_currency, converted_amount, to_currency))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Converting 100 USD to EUR with an exchange rate of 0.88: `convert_currency(100, 0.88, \"USD\", \"EUR\")` returns `88.0`\n* Converting 500 EUR to USD with an exchange rate of 1.14: `convert_currency(500, 1.14, \"EUR\", \"USD\")` returns `570.0`\n\n### Notes\n\n* This program assumes a simple exchange rate model where 1 unit of the base currency is equivalent to a fixed amount of the target currency.\n* In a real-world application, you would likely want to handle more complex exchange rate models and error checking.\n* You can modify the `from_currency` and `to_currency` variables to support different currency pairs.",
