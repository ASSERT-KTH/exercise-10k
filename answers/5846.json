  "answer": "**Coin Flip Simulator**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that simulates a coin flip by randomly choosing between \"heads\" and \"tails\" and printing the result.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a coin flip by randomly choosing between 'heads' and 'tails'.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The result of the coin flip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the possible outcomes of a coin flip\n    outcomes = [\"heads\", \"tails\"]\n    \n    # Randomly select an outcome\n    result = random.choice(outcomes)\n    \n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    # Simulate a coin flip\n    result = coin_flip()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The coin landed on: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `coin_flip` function defines the possible outcomes of a coin flip as a list `[\"heads\", \"tails\"]`.\n2. It uses the `random.choice` function to randomly select one of the outcomes.\n3. The selected outcome is returned as the result of the coin flip.\n4. In the `main` function, we simulate a coin flip by calling `coin_flip` and store the result.\n5. Finally, we print the result of the coin flip.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\nThe coin landed on: heads\n```\n\nNote: Since the outcome is randomly chosen, the output will be different each time you run the program.",
