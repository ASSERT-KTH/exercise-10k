  "answer": "Here's an example of how you could filter a list in Python:\n\n```python\ndef filter_list(input_list, condition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter a list and extract a subset of elements that meet a condition.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list (list): The input list to filter.\n        condition (function): A function that takes one argument and returns a boolean.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing only the elements that meet the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [x for x in input_list if condition(x)]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Filter the list to get only the even numbers\neven_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n# Filter the list to get only the numbers greater than 5\nlarge_numbers = filter_list(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)\nprint(large_numbers)  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a function `filter_list` that takes an input list and a condition function.\n2. The condition function should take one argument and return a boolean value.\n3. We use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the elements that meet the condition.\n4. We provide two example use cases: one to filter the list for even numbers and another to filter the list for numbers greater than 5.",
