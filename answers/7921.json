  "answer": "**Compound Interest Calculator Program**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following program calculates the compound interest given the principal, rate, and time. This program uses the formula for compound interest, which is:\n\nA = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest.\n\n    Args:\n    - principal (float): The initial amount of money.\n    - rate (float): The annual interest rate (in decimal).\n    - time (int): The time the money is invested for in years.\n    - compounding_frequency (int, optional): The number of times interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The amount of money accumulated after the given time, including interest.\n    - float: The compound interest.\n    \"\"\"\n    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounding_frequency)**(compounding_frequency*time)\n    interest = amount - principal\n    return amount, interest\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage\n    principal = 1000  # Initial amount of money\n    rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (5%)\n    time = 5  # Time in years\n    compounding_frequency = 1  # Compounded annually\n\n    amount, interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency)\n\n    print(f\"Principal: ${principal:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Annual Interest Rate: {rate*100}%\")\n    print(f\"Time: {time} years\")\n    print(f\"Compounding Frequency: {compounding_frequency} time(s) per year\")\n    print(f\"Amount after {time} years: ${amount:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Compound Interest: ${interest:.2f}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_compound_interest` function takes in the principal, rate, time, and compounding frequency as parameters.\n2. It calculates the amount of money accumulated after the given time using the compound interest formula.\n3. The compound interest is calculated by subtracting the principal from the amount.\n4. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `calculate_compound_interest` function with example values.\n5. The program prints out the principal, annual interest rate, time, compounding frequency, amount after the given time, and the compound interest.",
