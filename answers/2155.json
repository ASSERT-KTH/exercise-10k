  "answer": "**HTML File Reader Program**\n================================\n\nThis program reads an HTML file and prints out its contents.\n\n**Code**\n------\n\n```python\ndef read_html_file(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads an HTML file and returns its contents.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The path to the HTML file.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The contents of the HTML file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            contents = file.read()\n            return contents\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    file_path = input(\"Enter the path to the HTML file: \")\n    contents = read_html_file(file_path)\n    if contents:\n        print(contents)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n-------------\n\n1. The `read_html_file` function takes a file path as an argument and attempts to open the file in read mode.\n2. If the file is found, its contents are read and returned as a string.\n3. If the file is not found, an error message is printed and `None` is returned.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the path to the HTML file, calls `read_html_file`, and prints the contents if the file is found.\n5. The program uses a `try-except` block to handle the `FileNotFoundError` exception that may be raised if the file does not exist.\n\n**Example Usage**\n--------------\n\n1. Save the above code in a file named `html_reader.py`.\n2. Run the program using Python (e.g., `python html_reader.py`).\n3. Enter the path to an HTML file when prompted (e.g., `example.html`).\n4. The program will print the contents of the HTML file to the console.\n\nNote: This program assumes that the HTML file is encoded in a format that can be read by the Python `open` function in text mode (e.g., UTF-8). If the file uses a different encoding, you may need to specify the encoding when opening the file (e.g., `open(file_path, 'r', encoding='latin1')`).",
