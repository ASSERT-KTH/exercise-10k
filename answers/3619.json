  "answer": "### Calculating the Area of a Circle with a Nested Function\n#### Overview\n\nThe following Python code defines a function called `calculate_circle_area` that uses a nested function to calculate the area of a circle. This example demonstrates how to structure and use nested functions to encapsulate related functionality.\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_circle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a circle.\n\n    Args:\n    radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    def calculate_area(radius):\n        # Calculate the area using the formula \u03c0r\u00b2\n        return math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n\n    # Check if the radius is non-negative\n    if radius < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n\n    # Use the nested function to calculate the area\n    area = calculate_area(radius)\n    return area\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    radius = 5.0\n    area = calculate_circle_area(radius)\n    print(f\"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n*   The `calculate_circle_area` function takes the radius of the circle as input and returns the calculated area.\n*   Inside `calculate_circle_area`, a nested function called `calculate_area` is defined. This function calculates the area using the formula for the area of a circle (\u03c0r\u00b2).\n*   Before calling the nested function, the code checks if the provided radius is non-negative. If it's negative, a `ValueError` is raised.\n*   The `calculate_area` function is then called with the provided radius, and the calculated area is returned as the result.\n*   In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `calculate_circle_area` function with a sample radius and print the calculated area.",
