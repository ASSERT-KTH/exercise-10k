  "answer": "**Gross Pay Calculator Program**\n================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program calculates an employee's gross pay based on their hourly wage and number of hours worked.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef calculate_gross_pay(hourly_wage, hours_worked):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates an employee's gross pay.\n\n    Args:\n        hourly_wage (float): The employee's hourly wage.\n        hours_worked (float): The number of hours worked.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The employee's gross pay.\n    \"\"\"\n    if hourly_wage < 0 or hours_worked < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Hourly wage and hours worked must be non-negative\")\n\n    gross_pay = hourly_wage * hours_worked\n    return gross_pay\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    hourly_wage = float(input(\"Enter hourly wage: $\"))\n    hours_worked = float(input(\"Enter number of hours worked: \"))\n\n    # Calculate gross pay\n    gross_pay = calculate_gross_pay(hourly_wage, hours_worked)\n\n    # Print result\n    print(f\"Gross pay: ${gross_pay:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `calculate_gross_pay` function takes two arguments: `hourly_wage` and `hours_worked`.\n2. It checks if either value is negative and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n3. It calculates the gross pay by multiplying the hourly wage and hours worked.\n4. The `main` function gets user input for hourly wage and hours worked.\n5. It calls the `calculate_gross_pay` function with the user input and prints the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n1. Run the program.\n2. Enter an hourly wage (e.g., 20).\n3. Enter the number of hours worked (e.g., 40).\n4. The program will print the gross pay (e.g., $800.00).\n\nNote: This program assumes that the hourly wage and hours worked are non-negative. If either value is negative, it raises a `ValueError`.",
