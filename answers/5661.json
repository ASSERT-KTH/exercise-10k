  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The sum of num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 + num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the two numbers from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate and print the sum\n    sum_of_numbers = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n    print(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", sum_of_numbers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum.\n2. **Input**: The `main` function prompts the user to enter two numbers, converts them to floats (to allow for decimal numbers), and stores them in `num1` and `num2`.\n3. **Calculation**: It then calls `add_numbers` with `num1` and `num2` as arguments and stores the result in `sum_of_numbers`.\n4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the sum to the console.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Adding two integers: Input `5` and `7`, output will be `12`.\n- Adding two decimal numbers: Input `3.5` and `2.8`, output will be `6.3`.\n\n### How to Run\n\nSave this code in a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `sum_program.py`), then run it from the command line or terminal with `python sum_program.py`. Follow the prompts to input the numbers.",
