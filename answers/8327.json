  "prompt": "Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers. The program should take an array as input, iterate through each element, and keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. The program should then return the maximum value.",
  "answer": "Here is the code in Python that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef find(array):\n    max_num = array[0]\n    for num in array:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n\n# Test the function\nprint(find([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 5\nprint(find([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]))  # Output: -1\n```\nThis code defines a function `find` that takes an array as input and returns the maximum value in the array. The function initializes `max_num` to the first element of the array, then iterates through each element in the array. If it finds a value that is greater than `max_num`, it updates `max_num` to that value. Finally, it returns `max_num` as the maximum value in the array. The code also includes two test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.",
