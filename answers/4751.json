  "answer": "**Number Difference Program**\n================================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_difference(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the difference between two numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        num1 (float): The first number.\n        num2 (float): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The difference between num1 and num2.\n    \"\"\"\n    return num1 - num2\n\ndef main():\n    # Get user input\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    # Calculate the difference\n    difference = calculate_difference(num1, num2)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {difference}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* Calculate the difference between 10 and 5: `calculate_difference(10, 5)` returns `5.0`\n* Calculate the difference between -3 and 2: `calculate_difference(-3, 2)` returns `-5.0`\n\n### How to Run\n\n1. Save this code in a file named `difference.py`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Run the program by typing `python difference.py`.\n4. Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers.\n5. The program will print the difference between the two numbers.",
