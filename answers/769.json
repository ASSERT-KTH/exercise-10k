  "prompt": "Write a program that demonstrates the concept of pass by reference by passing a variable to a function and modifying it.",
  "answer": "Here's an example of a Python program that demonstrates the concept of pass by reference. In Python, variables that hold mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, etc.) are passed by reference, while variables that hold immutable objects (like integers, strings, etc.) are passed by value.\n\n```python\n# Python program to demonstrate the concept of pass by reference\n\ndef modify_list(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function modifies the input list by appending a new element.\n    \"\"\"\n    lst.append(10)\n    print(\"Inside function: \", lst)\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a list\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n    print(\"Original list: \", my_list)\n\n    # Pass the list to the function\n    modify_list(my_list)\n    print(\"List after modification: \", my_list)\n\n    # Create a new integer variable\n    my_int = 5\n    print(\"Original integer: \", my_int)\n\n    # Try to modify the integer in a function\n    def modify_int(x):\n        x = x + 10\n        print(\"Inside function: \", x)\n\n    modify_int(my_int)\n    print(\"Integer after 'modification': \", my_int)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, you'll see that the list is modified successfully, but the integer is not. This is because lists are mutable (can be changed after creation), while integers are immutable (cannot be changed after creation). When we pass the list to the function, we're actually passing a reference to the list, so any modifications made to the list inside the function affect the original list. However, when we pass the integer to the function, we're passing a copy of the integer's value, so any modifications made to the integer inside the function do not affect the original integer.\n\nHere's the output of the program:\n```\nOriginal list:  [1, 2, 3]\nInside function:  [1, 2, 3, 10]\nList after modification:  [1, 2, 3, 10]\nOriginal integer:  5\nInside function:  15\nInteger after 'modification':  5\n```",
