  "prompt": "Write a function that takes two lists as input, concatenates them, and returns the resulting list.",
  "answer": "Of course! I'll guide you through creating a function that combines two lists into one. This function will take two lists as input, merge them, and return the resulting list. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef concatenate_lists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two lists as input, concatenates them, and returns the resulting list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1 (list): The first list to be concatenated.\n        list2 (list): The second list to be concatenated.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list that is the result of concatenating list1 and list2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we check if both inputs are lists. If not, we raise a TypeError.\n    if not isinstance(list1, list) or not isinstance(list2, list):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both inputs must be lists.\")\n\n    # Now, we can use the + operator to concatenate the two lists. This operator returns a new list that contains all elements from both lists.\n    # We assign this new list to the result variable.\n    result = list1 + list2\n\n    # Finally, we return the result.\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `concatenate_lists` first checks if both inputs `list1` and `list2` are lists using the `isinstance` function. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n* It then uses the `+` operator to concatenate `list1` and `list2`, creating a new list that contains all elements from both lists, and assigns this new list to the `result` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the `result`, which is the concatenated list.\n* The function includes a docstring that provides a description of what the function does, explains the input parameters `list1` and `list2`, and describes the return value.",
