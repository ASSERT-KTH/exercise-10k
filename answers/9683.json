  "prompt": "Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should then print the results of each operation.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\ndef arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):\n    # Addition\n    sum = num1 + num2\n    print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {sum}\")\n\n    # Subtraction\n    diff = num1 - num2\n    print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {diff}\")\n\n    # Multiplication\n    product = num1 * num2\n    print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {product}\")\n\n    # Division\n    if num2 != 0:\n        quotient = num1 / num2\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {quotient}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 2\narithmetic_operations(num1, num2)\n```\nThis code defines the `arithmetic_operations` function, which performs the four basic arithmetic operations on the input numbers `num1` and `num2`. The function prints the results of each operation to the console, using f-strings to format the output.\n\nThe example usage at the end calls the `arithmetic_operations` function with `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 2` as input, and prints the results of the arithmetic operations.",
