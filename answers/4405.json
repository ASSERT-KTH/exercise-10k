  "answer": "**Calculating Average of a List of Numbers using a For Loop**\n\nHere's an example program in Python that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average of the numbers in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Initialize a variable `total` to 0 to keep track of the sum of the numbers.\n2. Iterate through the list of numbers using a for loop.\n3. In each iteration, add the current number to the `total`.\n4. After the loop, divide the `total` by the length of the list to get the average.\n5. Return the calculated average.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This program assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n* If you want to handle empty lists, you can add a simple check at the beginning of the function to return 0 or a specific value in that case. For example:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n    # rest of the function remains the same\n```",
