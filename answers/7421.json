  "prompt": "Create a program that takes a user's input and converts it into different data types. The program should be able to convert the input into an integer, float, and string. If the input cannot be converted into a specific data type, the program should display an error message.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements. This program will take a user's input and try to convert it into an integer, float, and string. If the conversion fails, it will display an error message.\n\n```python\ndef convert_input():\n    # Take user's input\n    user_input = input(\"Please enter a value: \")\n\n    # Try to convert the input into an integer\n    try:\n        int_value = int(user_input)\n        print(f\"Integer value: {int_value}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Input cannot be converted into an integer.\")\n\n    # Try to convert the input into a float\n    try:\n        float_value = float(user_input)\n        print(f\"Float value: {float_value}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Input cannot be converted into a float.\")\n\n    # Try to convert the input into a string\n    try:\n        str_value = str(user_input)\n        print(f\"String value: {str_value}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: An unexpected error occurred - {str(e)}\")\n\nconvert_input()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   We define a function `convert_input()` that takes the user's input using the built-in `input()` function.\n*   We use `try-except` blocks to catch any exceptions that occur during the conversion process. If the conversion fails, a `ValueError` exception is raised, and we display an error message.\n*   We attempt to convert the input into an integer using `int(user_input)`, a float using `float(user_input)`, and a string using `str(user_input)`.\n*   The converted values are then printed to the console. If an error occurs during the conversion, an error message is displayed instead.\n*   Note that converting a value to a string will always succeed, so the `try-except` block for string conversion is not strictly necessary. However, it's included here for completeness and to handle any unexpected errors that might occur.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   If the user enters a whole number (e.g., `123`), the program will successfully convert it into an integer, float, and string.\n*   If the user enters a decimal number (e.g., `123.45`), the program will successfully convert it into a float and string but will display an error message when trying to convert it into an integer.\n*   If the user enters a non-numeric value (e.g., `hello`), the program will display error messages when trying to convert it into an integer and float but will successfully convert it into a string.",
