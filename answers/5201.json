  "prompt": "Write a program that calculates the sum of two integers provided by the user.",
  "answer": "Here is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of two integers provided by the user:\n\n```python\n# Get the two integers from the user\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first integer: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second integer: \"))\n\n# Calculate the sum\nsum_of_integers = num1 + num2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The sum of the two integers is: \", sum_of_integers)\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. The `input()` function is used to get two integers from the user.\n2. The `int()` function is used to convert the user's input into integers, because `input()` returns a string by default.\n3. The `+` operator is used to calculate the sum of the two integers.\n4. The result is then printed to the console.\n\nYou can save this code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `sum_of_integers.py`) and run it from the command line using `python sum_of_integers.py`. Then, follow the prompts to enter the two integers and see the result.",
