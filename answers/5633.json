Define a `Node` class to represent individual nodes in the linked list.\n2.  Implement the `is_cyclic` function, which takes the head node of the linked list as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list is cyclic.\n3.  In the `is_cyclic` function:\n\n    *   If the head node is `None` or the head node's next node is `None`, the list is not cyclic, so return `False`.\n    *   Initialize two pointers, `tortoise` and `hare`, to the head node.\n    *   Move the `tortoise` one step at a time and the `hare` two steps at a time through the linked list.\n    *   If the `tortoise` and `hare` meet at any point, it means the linked list is cyclic, so return `True`.\n    *   If the `hare` reaches the end of the linked list without meeting the `tortoise`, the list is not cyclic, so return `False`.\n4.  In the `main` function:\n\n    *   Create a cyclic linked list by setting the `next` pointer of the last node to a previous node.\n    *   Create a non-cyclic linked list by setting the `next` pointer of the last node to `None`.\n    *   Call the `is_cyclic` function on both linked lists and print the results.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, because in the worst case, the tortoise and hare may need to traverse the entire list.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the tortoise and hare pointers.",
