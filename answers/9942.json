  "prompt": "Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a specified element in an array with a new element. The program should take as input the array, the element to be replaced, and the new element. The program should output the modified array.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Today's Date]\n\ndef replace_element(arr, old_element, new_element):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replace all occurrences of old_element in arr with new_element.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n        old_element: The element to be replaced.\n        new_element: The new element to replace old_element.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The modified array with all occurrences of old_element replaced.\n    \"\"\"\n    new_arr = []\n    for element in arr:\n        if element == old_element:\n            new_arr.append(new_element)\n        else:\n            new_arr.append(element)\n    return new_arr\n\n# Test the function\narr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\nold_element = 2\nnew_element = 10\nprint(replace_element(arr, old_element, new_element))\n```\nNote that I've assumed that the input array `arr` is a list of elements, and that the `old_element` and `new_element` can be any type of element (e.g., integers, strings, etc.). If you need to restrict the types of elements, you can modify the function accordingly.",
