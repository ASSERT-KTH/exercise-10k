  "answer": "**Binary Search Program**\n=========================\n\n### Overview\n\nThis program performs a binary search on a sorted list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers and a target number as input, and returns the index of the target number if found, or -1 if not found.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(numbers, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a binary search on a sorted list of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A sorted list of numbers.\n        target (int): The target number to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target number if found, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(numbers) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if numbers[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif numbers[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1\n\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    target = 5\n\n    result = binary_search(numbers, target)\n\n    if result != -1:\n        print(f\"Target number {target} found at index {result}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Target number {target} not found in the list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `binary_search` function takes a sorted list of numbers and a target number as input.\n2. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the list, respectively.\n3. The function enters a loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.\n4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range.\n5. It compares the value at the midpoint `numbers[mid]` to the target number.\n6. If the values match, the function returns the midpoint index.\n7. If the value at the midpoint is less than the target, the function updates the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n8. If the value at the midpoint is greater than the target, the function updates the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.\n9. If the loop ends without finding the target, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target is not in the list.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because the algorithm divides the search space in half with each iteration, resulting in a logarithmic number of comparisons.",
