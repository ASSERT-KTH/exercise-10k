  "prompt": "Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number. After each guess, the program should tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the generated number. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly.",
  "answer": "Here's a simple Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef number_guessing_game():\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    \n    # Initialize the number of tries\n    tries = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the number guessing game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Ask the user for their guess\n        user_guess = input(\"Take a guess: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to quit\n        if user_guess.lower() == \"quit\":\n            print(\"Okay, the number was {}.\".format(number_to_guess))\n            break\n        \n        # Try to convert the user's guess to an integer\n        try:\n            user_guess = int(user_guess)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Increment the number of tries\n        tries += 1\n        \n        # Check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number\n        if user_guess < number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n        elif user_guess > number_to_guess:\n            print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Congratulations! You found the number in {} tries.\".format(tries))\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_guessing_game()\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We first import the `random` module, which we'll use to generate the random number.\n2. We define a function `number_guessing_game` that contains the game logic.\n3. We generate a random number between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.\n4. We initialize a variable `tries` to keep track of the number of attempts the user makes.\n5. We enter a loop where we repeatedly ask the user for their guess.\n6. We check if the user wants to quit by typing \"quit\". If they do, we reveal the number and exit the loop.\n7. We try to convert the user's guess to an integer. If it's not a valid number, we print an error message and continue to the next iteration.\n8. We increment the `tries` variable.\n9. We check if the user's guess is higher or lower than the number. If it's too low or too high, we print a hint and continue to the next iteration. If it's correct, we congratulate the user and exit the loop.\n10. Finally, we call the `number_guessing_game` function if the script is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module).",
