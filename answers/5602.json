  "answer": "Here's a Python program that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    print(\"Simple Calculator Program\")\n    print(\"1. Addition\")\n    print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n    print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n    print(\"4. Division\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): \")\n\n    if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n        num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n        num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}\")\n\n        elif choice == '2':\n            print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}\")\n\n        elif choice == '3':\n            print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}\")\n\n        elif choice == '4':\n            if num2 != 0:\n                print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n\ndef main():\n    calculator()\n    again = input(\"Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n    while again.lower() == 'yes':\n        calculator()\n        again = input(\"Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n    print(\"Goodbye!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The `calculator()` function is the core of the program. It first prints a simple menu to let the user choose an operation.\n2. The user's choice is stored in the `choice` variable, which is then checked to ensure it is one of the allowed options.\n3. The user is then prompted to enter two numbers, which are stored in `num1` and `num2`.\n4. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding operation is performed, and the result is printed.\n5. The program includes a check for division by zero to prevent an error.\n6. The `main()` function controls the flow of the program. It first calls `calculator()` and then asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.\n7. If the user chooses to continue, the `calculator()` function is called again; otherwise, the program ends.",
