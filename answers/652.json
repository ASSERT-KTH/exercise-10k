  "answer": "**Basic Chatbot Program**\n==========================\n\nBelow is a simple Python program that responds to basic user input with pre-defined responses.\n\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport time\n\n# Define a dictionary with pre-defined responses\nresponses = {\n    'hello': 'Hello! How are you today?',\n    'hi': 'Hi! What can I help you with?',\n    'how are you': 'I\\'m doing great, thanks for asking!',\n    'what is your name': 'My name is Chatbot.',\n    'bye': 'Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.',\n    'default': 'I didn\\'t understand that. Please try again.'\n}\n\ndef get_response(user_input):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a pre-defined response based on the user's input.\n    \n    Args:\n        user_input (str): The user's input.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: A pre-defined response.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the user's input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    user_input = user_input.lower()\n    \n    # Check if the user's input matches any of the pre-defined responses\n    for key in responses:\n        if key in user_input:\n            return responses[key]\n    \n    # If no match is found, return the default response\n    return responses['default']\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Welcome to the chatbot program!\")\n    print(\"Type 'bye' to exit the program.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        # Get the user's input\n        user_input = input(\"You: \")\n        \n        # Check if the user wants to exit the program\n        if user_input.lower() == 'bye':\n            print(\"Chatbot: \", get_response(user_input))\n            break\n        \n        # Print the chatbot's response\n        print(\"Chatbot: \", get_response(user_input))\n        \n        # Add a short delay to simulate a conversation\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n--------------------\n\n1. User types \"hello\" and the chatbot responds with \"Hello! How are you today?\".\n2. User types \"how are you\" and the chatbot responds with \"I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\".\n3. User types \"what is your name\" and the chatbot responds with \"My name is Chatbot.\".\n4. User types \"bye\" and the chatbot responds with \"Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.\" and exits the program.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n-----------------------\n\n* To add more pre-defined responses, simply add more key-value pairs to the `responses` dictionary.\n* To make the chatbot more interactive, you can add more complex logic to the `get_response` function, such as using natural language processing (NLP) techniques or machine learning algorithms.\n* To deploy the chatbot on a web platform, you can use a web framework such as Flask or Django to create a web interface and integrate the chatbot logic.",
