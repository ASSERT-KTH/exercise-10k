  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a list and an element as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.",
  "answer": "Here is the Python code that implements the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef first_occurrence_index(lst, ele):\n    if lst is None:\n        return -1\n    try:\n        return lst.index(ele)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nele = 5\nprint(first_occurrence_index(lst, ele))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `first_occurrence_index` that takes a list `lst` and an element `ele` as input. It checks if the list is `None` and returns `-1` if it is. Otherwise, it uses the `index` method of the list to find the index of the first occurrence of the element. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `-1`. The code also includes an example usage of the function.",
