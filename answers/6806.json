  "prompt": "Write a program that takes a string input from the user, reverses the string, and checks if the original string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The program should print the reversed string and a message indicating whether the original string is a palindrome or not.",
  "answer": "Here is the code that meets the specifications:\n```\n# Author: [Your Name]\n# Date: [Current Date]\n\n# Get user input\nstr = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n\n# Reverse the string\nrev_str = str[::-1]\n\n# Check if the string is a palindrome\nif str == rev_str:\n    print(\"The string is a palindrome.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The string is not a palindrome.\")\n\n# Print the reversed string\nprint(\"The reversed string is: \", rev_str)\n\n# Print the original string\nprint(\"The original string is: \", str)\n```\nNote: I've left the author and date fields blank, as they are dependent on the individual creating the code. You should fill in your own name and date.",
