  "prompt": "Write a function to sort the characters in a given string. The function should return the sorted string.",
  "answer": "Absolutely! I'll outline a step-by-step solution to create a function that sorts the characters in a given string and returns the sorted string. This response will provide a clear plan and explanation to help implement the solution. Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef sort_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string as input, sorts its characters in ascending order, \n    and returns the sorted string.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The sorted string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we need to convert the string into a list because strings in Python are immutable\n    # and cannot be sorted directly.\n    char_list = list(s)\n    \n    # Now, we use the built-in sorted function in Python to sort the list of characters.\n    # The sorted function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.\n    sorted_list = sorted(char_list)\n    \n    # Finally, we join the sorted characters back into a string using the join method.\n    # The join method concatenates all the characters in the list into a single string.\n    sorted_string = ''.join(sorted_list)\n    \n    # We return the sorted string.\n    return sorted_string\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(sort_string(\"hello\"))  # Output: \"ehllo\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `sort_string` takes a string `s` as input and converts it into a list `char_list` because strings in Python are immutable and cannot be sorted directly.\n* It uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list of characters in ascending order and stores the result in `sorted_list`.\n* The sorted characters are then joined back into a string using the `join` method and stored in `sorted_string`.\n* Finally, the function returns the `sorted_string`.",
