  "answer": "**Longest Palindromic Substring Program**\n======================================\n\nThis program finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The longest palindromic substring.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def expand_around_center(left: int, right: int) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Expand around the center of the palindrome to find the longest palindromic substring.\n\n        Args:\n            left (int): The left index of the center.\n            right (int): The right index of the center.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The longest palindromic substring centered at (left, right).\n        \"\"\"\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return s[left + 1:right]\n\n    longest = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd-length palindrome\n        odd_palindrome = expand_around_center(i, i)\n        if len(odd_palindrome) > len(longest):\n            longest = odd_palindrome\n\n        # Even-length palindrome\n        even_palindrome = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)\n        if len(even_palindrome) > len(longest):\n            longest = even_palindrome\n\n    return longest\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_str = \"babad\"\n    print(\"Longest palindromic substring:\", longest_palindromic_substring(input_str))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Helper Function**: The `expand_around_center` function takes two indices, `left` and `right`, as the center of a potential palindrome. It expands around the center as long as the characters at the `left` and `right` indices are the same, effectively finding the longest palindromic substring centered at `(left, right)`.\n2.  **Main Function**: The `longest_palindromic_substring` function iterates through the input string `s`. For each character, it considers two possibilities:\n    *   **Odd-Length Palindrome**: It treats the current character as the center of an odd-length palindrome and uses the `expand_around_center` function to find the longest palindromic substring.\n    *   **Even-Length Palindrome**: It treats the current character and the next character as the center of an even-length palindrome and uses the `expand_around_center` function to find the longest palindromic substring.\n3.  **Longest Palindrome Update**: After finding the longest palindromic substring for both odd and even lengths, it updates the `longest` variable if a longer palindrome is found.\n4.  **Return Longest Palindrome**: Finally, the function returns the longest palindromic substring found.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, it potentially expands around the center to find the longest palindromic substring.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this program is O(1), excluding the space required for the input and output strings. This is because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the longest palindromic substring.",
