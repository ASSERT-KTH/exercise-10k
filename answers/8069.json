  "answer": "### Closure Function Example\n#### Overview\n\nA closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of its outer functions, even when the outer functions have returned. Here's an example of a function that returns another function with a closure:\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\ndef outer_function(name):\n    \"\"\"Outer function that returns an inner function with a closure.\"\"\"\n    def inner_function(age):\n        \"\"\"Inner function with access to the outer function's scope.\"\"\"\n        return f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n    return inner_function\n\n# Example usage:\ngreet_john = outer_function(\"John\")\nprint(greet_john(30))  # Output: Hello, John! You are 30 years old.\n\ngreet_jane = outer_function(\"Jane\")\nprint(greet_jane(25))  # Output: Hello, Jane! You are 25 years old.\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. The `outer_function` takes a `name` parameter and returns the `inner_function`.\n2. The `inner_function` takes an `age` parameter and has access to the `name` variable from the `outer_function`'s scope.\n3. When we call `outer_function(\"John\")`, it returns the `inner_function` with the `name` variable set to `\"John\"`.\n4. We assign the returned `inner_function` to the `greet_john` variable.\n5. When we call `greet_john(30)`, it executes the `inner_function` with the `age` parameter set to `30` and the `name` variable still set to `\"John\"`, resulting in the output `\"Hello, John! You are 30 years old.\"`\n\nThis example demonstrates how the `inner_function` maintains a reference to the `outer_function`'s scope, even after the `outer_function` has returned. This is the essence of a closure.",
