  "answer": "**Matrix Printer Program**\n==========================\n\n### Description\n\nThis program uses a for loop to print a given matrix.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef print_matrix(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a given matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list of lists): The matrix to print.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in matrix:\n        for element in row:\n            print(element, end=' ')\n        print()\n\n# Example usage\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n]\n\nprint(\"Given Matrix:\")\nprint_matrix(matrix)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. The `print_matrix` function takes a matrix as input, which is a list of lists.\n2. The outer for loop iterates over each row in the matrix.\n3. The inner for loop iterates over each element in the current row.\n4. The `print` function is used to print each element, with the `end=' '` argument to print all elements in a row on the same line, separated by spaces.\n5. After printing all elements in a row, the `print` function is called without arguments to move to the next line.\n\n### Output\n\n```\nGiven Matrix:\n1 2 3 \n4 5 6 \n7 8 9 \n```\n\nYou can modify the `matrix` variable to print a different matrix.",
