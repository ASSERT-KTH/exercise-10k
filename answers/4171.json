  "answer": "**Scramble Word Program**\n=========================\n\nBelow is a Python solution that uses the `random` library to shuffle the letters of the input word.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef scramble_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrambles the letters of the input word.\n\n    Args:\n        word (str): The word to scramble.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The scrambled word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_list = list(word)  # Convert the word to a list\n    random.shuffle(word_list)  # Shuffle the list\n    return ''.join(word_list)  # Convert the list back to a string\n\ndef main():\n    word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n    scrambled_word = scramble_word(word)\n    print(f\"Scrambled word: {scrambled_word}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Run the program and enter a word when prompted.\n* The program will output the scrambled word.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. The `scramble_word` function takes a word as input and converts it to a list of characters.\n2. The `random.shuffle` function is used to shuffle the list of characters.\n3. The shuffled list is then converted back to a string and returned.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user for a word, scrambles it using the `scramble_word` function, and prints the result.\n\nNote: This program will produce a different scrambled word each time it is run, due to the random nature of the shuffle operation.",
