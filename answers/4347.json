  "prompt": "Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year and prints 'Leap Year' if true, otherwise prints 'Not a Leap Year'",
  "answer": "Here's a Python program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not:\n\n```python\ndef check_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"Check if a given year is a leap year.\"\"\"\n    if year % 4 == 0:\n        if year % 100 == 0:\n            if year % 400 == 0:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    year = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\n    if check_leap_year(year):\n        print(f\"{year} is a Leap Year\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{year} is Not a Leap Year\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The `check_leap_year` function checks whether a year is a leap year or not. \n- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400.\n- In the `main` function, the user is asked to input a year.\n- Based on the result of the `check_leap_year` function, it prints whether the given year is a leap year or not.\n\nYou can also simplify the `check_leap_year` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef check_leap_year(year):\n    \"\"\"Check if a given year is a leap year.\"\"\"\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n```\n\nThis function uses the logical operators `and` and `or` to simplify the conditions for a leap year.",
