  "answer": "Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to find the indices of a subsequence in a string:\n```python\ndef find_subsequence_indices(string, subsequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the indices of a subsequence in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n        subsequence (str): The subsequence to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of indices where the subsequence appears in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a 2D table to store the lengths of common prefixes\n    dp = [[0] * (len(subsequence) + 1) for _ in range(len(string) + 1)]\n\n    # Fill the table in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(subsequence) + 1):\n            if string[i - 1] == subsequence[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 0\n\n    # Find the indices of the subsequence\n    indices = []\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if dp[i + 1][len(subsequence)] == len(subsequence):\n            indices.append(i - len(subsequence) + 1)\n\n    return indices\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"banana\"\nsubsequence = \"ana\"\nindices = find_subsequence_indices(string, subsequence)\nprint(indices)  # Output: [1, 3]\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We create a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(len(string) + 1) x (len(subsequence) + 1)` to store the lengths of common prefixes between the string and the subsequence.\n2. We fill the table in a bottom-up manner by iterating over the characters of the string and the subsequence. If the current characters match, we increment the length of the common prefix by 1. Otherwise, we reset the length to 0.\n3. We then iterate over the string and check if the length of the common prefix at each position is equal to the length of the subsequence. If it is, we add the starting index of the subsequence to the `indices` list.\n4. Finally, we return the `indices` list, which contains the starting indices of all occurrences of the subsequence in the string.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n \\* m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the subsequence. The space complexity is O(n \\* m) as well, due to the 2D table used to store the lengths of common prefixes.",
