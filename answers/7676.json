  "answer": "**Calculating the Factorial of a Number**\n==========================================\n\n### Function Description\n\nThe following function calculates the factorial of a given integer. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given integer.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input number is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Example usage\ndef main():\n    num = 5\n    try:\n        factorial = calculate_factorial(num)\n        print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The function `calculate_factorial(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.\n*   It first checks if the input number is negative. If so, it raises a `ValueError` because the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n*   If the input number is 0 or 1, it returns 1, as the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined to be 1.\n*   For input numbers greater than 1, it calculates the factorial using a `for` loop, multiplying all integers from 2 to `n` (inclusive).\n*   The `main` function demonstrates how to use `calculate_factorial` with an example input and handles any potential errors.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because the function uses a single loop that runs from 2 to n. The space complexity is O(1), as the function uses a constant amount of space to store the result and temporary variables.",
