  "answer": "Here's a Python program that performs the requested operations:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to perform arithmetic operations\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes two numbers as input, performs addition, subtraction, \n    multiplication, and division operations, and prints the results.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    num1 (float): The first number.\n    num2 (float): The second number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero error\n    if num2 == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n    else:\n        # Perform addition\n        addition_result = num1 + num2\n        print(f\"Addition: {num1} + {num2} = {addition_result}\")\n\n        # Perform subtraction\n        subtraction_result = num1 - num2\n        print(f\"Subtraction: {num1} - {num2} = {subtraction_result}\")\n\n        # Perform multiplication\n        multiplication_result = num1 * num2\n        print(f\"Multiplication: {num1} * {num2} = {multiplication_result}\")\n\n        # Perform division\n        division_result = num1 / num2\n        print(f\"Division: {num1} / {num2} = {division_result}\")\n\n# Take two numbers as input from the user\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n# Call the function to perform arithmetic operations\nperform_arithmetic_operations(num1, num2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **Function Definition**: We define a function called `perform_arithmetic_operations` that takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n2.  **Division by Zero Check**: Before performing the division operation, we check if the second number (`num2`) is zero to avoid a division by zero error. If `num2` is zero, we print an error message.\n3.  **Arithmetic Operations**: We perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, respectively, and store the results in variables (`addition_result`, `subtraction_result`, `multiplication_result`, and `division_result`).\n4.  **Printing Results**: We print the results of each operation using f-strings, which allow us to embed expressions inside string literals.\n5.  **User Input**: We take two numbers as input from the user using the `input` function and convert them to floating-point numbers using the `float` function.\n6.  **Function Call**: We call the `perform_arithmetic_operations` function with the user-input numbers as arguments to perform the arithmetic operations and print the results.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   Enter two non-zero numbers, for example, `10` and `2`, to perform all four arithmetic operations.\n*   Enter a zero as the second number, for example, `10` and `0`, to test the division by zero error handling.",
